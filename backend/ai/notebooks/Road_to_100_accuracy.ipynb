      "Answer: C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: According to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 and Unitary Patent Guide, para. 65, a translation may be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU, except English, irrespective of the language in which the application was filed or the geographical extent of the unitary effect. This means that Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA (Unified Patent Court Agreement). Hence, option C is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation for why other options are incorrect:\n",
      "- Option A: While Dutch might be one of the languages in which the application was filed, the requirement is to provide a translation into an official language of any state with unitary effect, not necessarily the same as the language of filing. Therefore, it's not exclusive to Dutch.\n",
      "- Option B: This statement is too narrow as it only considers 18 states and does not cover all 24 EU member states that have signed the UPCA.\n",
      "- Option D: Spanish is one of the official languages of the EPC (European Patent Convention) but was not mentioned in the context provided for the unitary effect, making it an incorrect choice.\n",

      "Answer: C, Justification: According to Rule 21(1) EPC as stated in one of the legal bases provided, a wrong designation of an inventor can be corrected if requested by the patent proprietor. However, it also states that where the name of the inventor is not the same as recorded in the Register, the formalities officer will inform the patentee of the correct name. In this case, Ms Smith was erroneously designated as an inventor and Mr Li needs to give his consent for her deletion from the record. Therefore, option C is correct.\n",

      "Option A is incorrect because it does not mention the requirement of obtaining consent from Mr Li. The correction process must involve both the patentee and the person whose name is being corrected.\n",
      "Option B is incorrect because there can still be proceedings to correct the inventor's details even if no opposition has been filed against the European patent.\n",
      "Option D is incorrect as it suggests that only Ms Smith's consent is required, whereas according to Rule 21(1) EPC, Mr Li needs to give his consent for her deletion.\n",

      "Answer: A, Justification: According to Rule 142(3) (i) from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if Article 133(2) is applicable (mandatory appointment of a representative), the European patent application will be deemed withdrawn or the European patent revoked if information about the new representative is not submitted within two months after this communication.

      "\n",
      "Option D is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B - it includes a date that exceeds the allowable time frame and adds an unnecessary step by mentioning 'in good time' which is not explicitly required but could imply exceeding the two-month period.\n",

      "Final answer: A\n",
      "Answer: A, Justification: The correct answer is A. According to the provided legal text, an applicant for a European patent can apply to have their rights re-established if they were unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO despite taking all due care required by the circumstances (see Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3). This includes missed payment deadlines such as the designation fee. The text does not specifically mention that re-establishment of rights can be used for other time limits like requesting examination, filing within the priority period, or paying a fee for re-establishment (options B, C, and D).\n",
      "\n",
      "Option B is incorrect because the text outlines specific procedures for requesting further processing, which are different from re-establishment of rights. The process for re-establishing rights does not cover missed deadlines for actions like requesting examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option C is incorrect as there is no mention of using re-establishment of rights for filing within the priority period. Generally, such issues would be resolved by re-filing the application or other means, but this specific context in the text does not indicate that re-establishment of rights can be used here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option D is incorrect because paying a fee for re-establishment itself cannot be remedied through re-establishment of rights; it’s the missed payment deadline that could potentially be resolved by applying for re-establishment. The process of requesting re-establishment of rights does not involve an additional fee payment.\n",

A declaration of such entitlement has  been made by crossing the relevant box on Form  1001.', 'options': ['A. A Spanish European patent attorney files a European patent application in Spanish for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and of Andorra n nationality .', 'B. A firm whose principal place of business is in Germany and a natural person who is resident in Germany  and of Dutch nationality  jointly file a European patent application in Dutch.

A natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality files a European patent application in Italian.']}\n",
      "Final answer: B\n",
      "Answer: B, Justification: According to Rule 6 EPC, a reduction in filing fees can be granted if the applicant is a resident of a country that provides for such reductions under national law or if they are a firm with at least 20 employees and an annual turnover of at least EUR 3 million. Option B describes a situation where a German firm, which employs over 200 people and has an annual turnover of more than EUR 60 million, files a European patent application in Dutch with a natural person resident in Germany as co-applicant. Both conditions are met, making this the correct scenario for a reduction in filing fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option A is incorrect because while a Spanish European patent attorney can file in Spanish, the applicant's nationality and residence (resident in Andorra and of Andorra nationality) do not qualify for a reduced fee under Rule 6 EPC as there is no specific provision for residents or nationals of Andorra. \n",
      "\n",
      "Option C is incorrect since a natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality filing in French does not meet any criteria for reduced fees as per Rule 6 EPC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option D is similarly incorrect, as a natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality cannot qualify for a reduction under Rule 6 EPC due to neither their residence nor nationality fitting the specified conditions.\n",

      "Answer: B, Justification: The correct answer is B because according to the legal text provided in R.36(2), if a European divisional application is filed and it is not in an official EPO language, then within two months of filing, a translation into the language of the proceedings of the earlier (parent) application must be filed. In this case, since Mr Van Holland's parent application was filed in Dutch, which is an admissible non-EPO language under R.6(3)-(7), he needs to file an English translation of EP-div within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC (as per B option). \n",

      "Option C suggests filing both an English translation and a request for further processing, but this is not necessary according to the legal text provided. Filing the required translation within two months suffices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option D proposes filing an English translation and a request for re-establishment of rights. This is incorrect because there is no indication that Mr Van Holland has lost his rights due to non-compliance with language requirements, only that he needs to file the translation as per R.36(2). The process does not involve requesting re-establishment of rights.\n",

Thus, the renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid centrally to the EPO and the due date is 30 November 2023.\n",

      "Final answer: A\n",
      "Answer: A, Justification: According to EPC Rule 64(1), if the European Patent Office (EPO) acting as International Searching Authority (ISA) considers that an application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention, a partial search report is drawn up for parts of the application relating to the first mentioned invention. A further search fee must be paid for each additional invention within the two-month period starting from the date of receipt of the ISA's communication. In this case, you received such a communication on 25 September 2024 and have until 25 October 2024 to pay any required additional search fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Option B is incorrect because EPC Rule 64(1) states that the ISA must inform the applicant about the partial search report, which implies that you should respond with a statement or a request for further information if necessary.\n",
      "- Option C is incorrect according to EPC Rule 70(2)(b), which does not mention protest fees when paying under protest. Therefore, there's no obligation to pay two protest fees within the time limit as stated in this option.\n",
      "- Option D is incorrect because if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the EPO may issue a report on those parts of your application for which the fee has been paid and continue examination. The application would only be deemed withdrawn if no communication was issued, but here an ISA communication was provided with specific instructions regarding payment.\n",

Therefore, option A 'Request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO' is the correct course of action.\n",

When amending claims, he is allowed to file them in the language of the application as long as he provides a translation into any official language of the EPO, such as English, within the specified period (Rule 71(3) EPC). \n",
      "\n",
      "Option A is incorrect because it suggests that Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish and then provide a translation into English. This would not be allowed since he can choose to file the amended claims in any official language of the EPO, as long as they are accompanied by a translation within four months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Option B is partially correct but misleading because it does not specify that Korhonen must provide a translation into an official language of the EPO. Therefore, option C better reflects the legal text since it requires filing a translation in any of the official languages of the EPO (in this case, English).\n",
      "\n",
      "Option D is incorrect because it suggests that Korhonen cannot file the amended claims in Finnish at all. The legal context allows for the possibility of amending claims in the language of the application as long as they are accompanied by an appropriate translation.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "The time limit for filing an application within the priority period can be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights under Article 122(1). This is because re-establishment of rights is available when an applicant, despite taking all due care required by the circumstances, was unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO.

      "According to Rule 6 EPC, a reduction in the filing fee is available for natural persons and small entities. Under Art. 58(2)(a) and (b) of the EPC, an applicant can be a natural person or a legal entity that qualifies as a small entity under the conditions set by Rule 3.14 EPC.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option B** correctly identifies two applicants: a firm whose principal place of business is in Germany and a natural person resident in Germany but of Dutch nationality. The reduction applies to natural persons irrespective of their residence or nationality, provided they make the necessary declaration as stated in the question (crossing the relevant box on Form 1001). However, small entities must also meet certain criteria specified by Rule 3.14 EPC; typically, these relate to size and turnover.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option A:** The Spanish European patent attorney filing for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and of Andorran nationality does not satisfy the condition that an applicant can only be entitled if they are a legal entity or individual residing within the territory of one of the contracting states. Andorra is not part of the EPC, so this option would fail the residency requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option C:** The natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality does not meet the criterion that applicants must reside in the territory of one of the EPO's member states. Therefore, while they can still file a patent application, they cannot claim entitlement to reduced fees due to residence outside the contracting states' territories.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Option D:** The natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality faces similar issues as option C: their residence outside the territory of one of the EPC’s member states disqualifies them from claiming the filing fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n",

Form 1226CC (Option C) would be issued if there was a need for supplementary European search, but the text specifies that amendments under Rule 161(2) are being considered first. This suggests a preliminary step before any further examination or supplementary search steps. \\nForm 1226AC (Option D) indicates the start of substantive examination, which does not apply here since the application is still in an amendment and preparation stage prior to any formal examination proceedings.\\nIn conclusion, the correct form issued under these circumstances is Form 1226BB, offering the opportunity to comment and file amendments. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\"\n",

      "- **Option C**: \"The applicant can choose the Austrian Patent Office as ISA and the EPO as IPEA.\" This is incorrect because while the Austrian Patent Office (APO) does serve as an ISA, it is not a commonly selected ISA for PCT applications.

      "#### Incorrect Options:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option B (7 November 2023):** This date is incorrect because the time limit for adding priorities extends up to thirty months from 3 July 2022, which falls on 3 November 2024. Thus, any claim must be within this period.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option C (12 October 2023):** This date is incorrect as it suggests that the priority addition should have been made by today’s date.

Option C is wrong as the regulations allow for withdrawal within a specific timeframe, implying there could potentially be a refund if withdrawn before that time limit. Option D is also incorrect because once substantive examination begins, refunds are typically not available per Article 11 RFEPC.\"\n",

If firm A's European patent is maintained by the opposition division, an interested party like Firm B could file an appeal against such a decision if they disagree with the outcome.\n",

      "- **Option A:** This option suggests that at the end of the opposition proceedings, the patent was revoked and Firm B (the opponent) would be entitled to appeal. According to Article 102(3)(a) EPC, only parties directly affected by an interlocutory decision can file an appeal against a revocation decision. In this context, it is firm A (patent proprietor) who would have the right to appeal if the patent was revoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option C:** This option suggests that Firm C could file an appeal even though Firm C merely filed observations under Article 115 EPC and was not formally part of the opposition proceedings. According to Rule 78(2)(a) EPC, only parties named in the summons (i.e., the patent proprietor and any opponent like Firm B) can be appellants or respondents.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option D:** If Firm B withdrew its opposition during the opposition proceedings, Firm B would no longer be a party with standing to appeal against an interlocutory decision by the opposition division. Only parties directly affected by the outcome (i.e., the patent proprietor) would have standing to challenge such a decision if they disagree.\n",

      "According to Rule 71a(6), if a European patent application is refused, withdrawn before notification of the decision on the grant of a European patent or deemed to be withdrawn at that time, the fee for grant and publishing will be refunded. However, this rule does not directly address renewal fees after unitary effect registration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the context:\n",
      "- The filing date was October 1, 2020.\n",
      "- Renewal fees are generally due on a yearly basis starting from the third year post-filing (i.e., from October 1, 2023).\n",

      "- **Option A**: This statement is incorrect because once the unitary effect is registered, there are no further renewal fees due for EP-X within the participating EU states.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Option B**: Incorrect as well. The registration of unitary effect on October 10, 2024, means that there are no renewal fees due for EP-X-C0.\n",

      "In the context of renewal fees:\n",
      "- Renewal fees are due in respect of the third year and each subsequent year, calculated from the date of filing (Rule 86(1)).\n",
      "- For EP-X, the first renewal fee would be due for the third-year period starting on 1 October 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, when a European patent is granted unitary effect, it transforms into a European Patent with Unitary Effect (EPUE). The EPUE does not require further payment of renewal fees. Once an application gains unitary effect, the patent becomes EP-X-C0 and no longer incurs renewal fees for subsequent years.\n",

      "- **Option A:** Incorrect because a divisional or parent application that gains unitary effect does not require any more renewal payments after registration of unitary effect.\n",

      "D.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Why Option D is Correct:**\n",
      "   - According to EPC Rule 71a(5), when a European patent application is granted and unitary effect is registered, no renewal fees are due for the period of unitary protection.\n",
      "   - In this case, the mention of grant was published on October 2, 2024, and the unitary effect registration was confirmed by communication dated October 10, 2024. This means that as of October 10, 2024, the European patent EP-X now has unitary effect under EP-X-C0.\n",
      "   - Since the unitary protection starts from the date of grant (October 2, 2024) and no renewal fees are due for this period, there is no need to pay a renewal fee on October 31, 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n",
      "   - **Option A:** Renewal fees would typically be required if the application did not have unitary effect. However, given that EP-X-C0 has unitary effect registered from October 10, 2024, renewal fees for the fifth year (which would fall due at the end of September 2025) are waived.\n",
      "   - **Option B:** Renewal fees are not applicable to a European patent with unitary effect. The registration of unitary effect on EP-X-C0 eliminates any need for payment of renewal fees during this period.\n",
      "   - **Option C:** Again, the same logic applies as above. No renewal fee is due in respect of the 6th year (2025-2026) because the patent now has unitary effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, no renewal fee needs to be paid on October 31, 2024, for EP-X-C0, making Option D the correct choice.\n",

This means that as of October 10, 2024, the European patent EP-X now has unitary effect under EP-X-C0, starting from the date of grant (October 2, 2024).

      "1. **Correct Choice and Reasoning:**\n",
      "   - According toR. 126(2) EPC, if a document is delivered by postal services and arrives within seven days after the date it bears (registered letter), it shall be deemed delivered on that date.\n",
      "   - In this case, the communication dated 12 September 2024 was received by the applicant on 21 September 2024. The difference between these dates is nine days, which exceeds seven days.\n",
      "   - Therefore, since the receipt of the document exceeded seven days (i.e., 9 days), according toR. 126(2) EPC, a period for which the deemed receipt of that document is the relevant event under R. 131 shall be extended by the number of days exceeding seven days.\n",
      "   - Thus, the reply period (four months from 12 September 2024) will be extended by two days (9-7=2), resulting in a new deadline of **12 January 2025**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorrect Choices:**\n",
      "   - **Option A**: 13 January 2025 is incorrect because the extension period would only be two additional days based onR. 126(2) EPC, and not three.\n",
      "   - **Option C**: 22 January 2025 would imply an extension of ten days (rather than two), which does not align with R. 126(2) EPC where the delay in receipt is nine days beyond seven days.\n",
      "   - **Option D**: 14 January 2025 assumes a four-day extension, again contrary toR. 126(2) EPC where only two additional days are provided for when delivery exceeds seven days.\n",

The standard processes and systems should be sufficient during normal operations, including after-hours submissions through other electronic methods. Option B is incorrect as well. If only a technical issue at your end arises while the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, you would typically resolve or work around that issue without needing to use the Contingency Upload Service, which implies broader system failure rather than individual user issues. Option D is also incorrect because official holidays should not require special document submission methods. The regular processes and allowances for late submissions due to public holidays or non-working days are already established by EPO rules and do not necessitate using a contingency service specifically for such situations.\"\n",

      "A. Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish and must then provide a translation into English, in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the provided legal text (Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V 1.3), if an applicant files claims in a language other than one of the official languages of the European Patent Office (English, French, or German), they must provide translations into the two remaining official languages within four months from the date of the communication under Rule 71(3). In this scenario, Korhonen, being a Finnish national and having filed his claims in Finnish, would need to provide an English translation within the stipulated time frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option B:** This option is incorrect because it suggests that Korhonen can provide a translation into any official language of the EPO. However, since the original filing was made in Finnish and the language of proceedings might be English (as provided by Korhonen initially), he must specifically translate his claims into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option C:** This option is partially correct but misleading as it suggests that the amended claims can be filed only in Finnish followed by an English translation. The specific regulation requires translations to two official languages, not just one. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Option D:** This option is incorrect because it states that Korhonen is not allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish. However, given his nationality and place of residence, he can indeed file the amendments in Finnish, provided he follows through with the required translation into English within the specified period.\n",
      "\n",

Since Korhonen filed his claims in Finnish and the language of proceedings might be English, he is required to translate his claims into English.

      "**Answer D**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Option A (Incorrectly Noted as Correct)**: \n",
      "   - The conditions for PCT Direct include having a priority application searched by the EPO and being submitted in one of the official languages of the EPO (English, French or German). If a Belgian application was filed in French and has been searched, then it meets these requirements. Filing an international application in French using ePCT-Filing would also meet the conditions for PCT Direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Option B (Incorrectly Noted as Correct)**:\n",
      "   - Here, the priority application is an EP application filed in French and subsequently searched by EPO. The subsequent international application can be filed in English and processed through Online Filing 2.0. This would still meet the criteria for PCT Direct since both applications are being managed under conditions that allow streamlined processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Option C (Incorrectly Noted as Correct)**:\n",
      "   - An international application previously filed with EPO in English, which has been searched by EPO, serves well as a basis for another international application to be filed also in English via Online Filing 2.0. This scenario fits the conditions for PCT Direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Option D (Correctly Noted as Incorrect)**:\n",
      "   - The requirement that \"amended claims are filed with the PCT Direct letter, in a single PDF document\" is not correct according to the provided context about PCT Direct procedures. Generally, informal comments aimed at overcoming objections raised by EPO's search opinion should be contained within the PCT Direct letter itself, but there’s no specific requirement for amended claims being part of this letter or in any particular format like a single PDF document.\n",

      "Answer: D\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why D is correct. According to Rule 21(1) EPC, an incorrect designation of inventor shall be rectified upon request and only with the consent of the wrongly designated person. Since Ms Smith was erroneously designated as an inventor, she must give her consent for this correction to take place.\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect. There is no requirement that proceedings must be pending before the EPO in order to rectify an incorrect designation of inventors. The issue can be addressed even if there are no pending proceedings.\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Rule 21(1) does not require Mr Li's consent for this rectification; it requires only Ms Smith’s consent as she was the wrongly designated inventor.\n",
      "- Explanation of why A is incorrect. While the patent proprietor can request that Ms Smith be deleted, such a change cannot occur without Ms Smith’s explicit consent per Rule 21(1) EPC.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: A\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why A is correct. According to EPO regulations and the given context, new representative Y needs to request a change of representative, file a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest (since that’s the deadline for responding), and also ensure that an authorization signed by the applicant is filed in good time. This ensures that there are no issues related to the change of representation, and rights over the application EP -A will be preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Option B omits the requirement to file an authorization signed by the applicant, which is crucial for validating the new representative Y’s actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Option C suggests that the response to the extended European search report should be filed by 23 October 2023 at the latest, but this date is after the actual deadline (12 October 2023) for responding to the extended European search report published on 12 April 2023. Thus, missing this deadline would lead to loss of rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Option D also suggests filing a response by 23 October 2023 at the latest and includes filing an authorization signed by the applicant. However, like option C, it fails to meet the critical deadline for responding (12 October 2023), which would result in a loss of rights for European patent application EP -A.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: A\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Justification: - **Explanation of why A is correct:** According to Article 122 and Rule 136 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, re-establishment of rights can be requested if an applicant was unable to observe a time limit despite taking all due care. The time limit for paying the designation fee (option A) falls under these circumstances where the request for re-establishment of rights is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect:**\n",
      "  - **B:** Time limit for requesting examination cannot be remedied by a request for re-establishment of rights. The rules specifically do not provide for re-establishing rights in this case. Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) is considered an independent procedural act and not subject to the re-establishment provisions.\n",
      "  - **C:** Time limit for filing the application within the priority period (priority claim time limit) cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights. According to Article 87, if the application was not filed within the required timeframe from the original filing date, the priority is lost and there are no mechanisms provided in the rules for reinstatement.\n",
      "  - **D:** Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself is a prerequisite for initiating the re-establishment process. If this time limit is missed, it implies that the applicant has not even initiated the request to re-establish their rights, hence this option does not make sense within the context provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, only the time limit for paying the designation fee can be remedied through requesting re-establishment of rights as per the applicable EPO regulations.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: C\n",
      "Answer: C\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why C is incorrect: According to PCT provisions, it is not mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination be signed by Greta or Hassan. The relevant rules do not specifically mandate who must sign the demand; they simply state that the applicant can appoint a representative and that such a representative may act on their behalf, subject to specific requirements of the authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why A is correct: Hassan can represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority for PCT-G if he has been given proper authorization by Greta. The PCT allows representation before search authorities without necessarily requiring a European patent attorney.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Explanation of why B is correct: For Hassan to act on behalf of Greta before the EPO, it would typically be necessary to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta to establish formal authority for Hassan’s actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is correct: According to PCT provisions, an international application can only be withdrawn by the applicant or an agent appointed by a validly executed power of attorney. This ensures that withdrawal decisions are made with proper authorization and representation.\n",

      "Final answer: C\n",
      "Answer: C\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why C is correct. According to Rule 6 EPC, an individual applicant who is a natural person and resident outside the European Patent Office’s (EPO) contracting states or certain listed countries can be entitled to reduced fees if they are of nationalities of such contracting states. The person in option C is a natural person resident in the USA (a non-contracting state) but holds Belgian nationality (a contracting state). This satisfies the criteria for entitlement under Rule 6 EPC.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect.\n",
      "  - Option A: Though the applicant here is from Andorra, which would generally qualify as an individual applicant resident outside the European Union, crossing the box on Form 1001 alone does not suffice if there’s any uncertainty or additional requirements that might disqualify this scenario. Additionally, filing in Spanish by a patent attorney doesn't necessarily mean entitlement to reduced fees under Rule 6 EPC.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - Option B: This option involves two applicants (a firm and an individual) jointly filing the application, which means they do not qualify for any fee reduction as per Rule 6 EPC. The criteria for reduced fees require that only one natural person who is resident in a non-contracting state can make such a declaration.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - Option D: This option involves an applicant from the USA but of Swiss nationality. While the individual meets the condition of being resident outside a contracting state and holding nationality of one, filing the application in Italian (a language not aligned with their nationality or place of residence) might lead to additional scrutiny that could disqualify them under Rule 6 EPC’s criteria for reduced fees.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: A\n",
      "Answer: A\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why A is correct: According to R. 36(2) EPC and related guidelines, if a divisional application (EP-div) is filed in an admissible non-EPO language like Dutch but not accompanied by the required translation into the official EPO language (English), it will result in a loss of rights as noted in Rule 112(1). Since Mr Van Holland did not file an English translation within two months, he cannot now remedy this deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect: According to R. 58 and Art. 90(3) EPC, once the noting of loss of rights (under Rule 112(1)) has been issued for a required translation not filed in due time, it cannot be remedied by filing an English translation within two months from notification.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Further processing requests under Rule 137 EPC are applicable to deficiencies that can still be remedied; however, the loss of rights noted under Rule 112(1) due to non-compliance with translation requirements cannot be cured by merely filing a translation and requesting further processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Re-establishment of rights under Article 122 EPC involves demonstrating that the delay was beyond the control of the applicant. Given the specific requirement for timely translations, re-establishing rights would not apply as the failure to meet this procedural requirement cannot be rectified retroactively.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: C\n",
      "Answer: C\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why C is correct: According to Rule 51 EPC and the provided information, after the mention of grant publication, renewal fees for subsequent years must be paid directly to the national offices (i.e., separately in each state where validation occurs). Additionally, there is a grace period allowed if the fees are not paid by the exact due date. The decision to grant on October 12, 2023, implies that the mention of grant will typically be published about two months later. Thus, for EP-A filed on November 16, 2020, the fourth-year renewal fee would normally be due on November 16, 2023. With a typical grace period of two months from the publication of the European Patent Bulletin (EPB), this implies that payment is valid without additional fees until January 9, 2024.\n",
      "- Explanation of why A and B are incorrect: Option A incorrectly states that the renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid centrally to the EPO. After grant, these fees should be paid directly to national offices in the chosen validation states. Option B has the correct due date (30 November 2023), but it also incorrectly suggests central payment through the EPO.\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While D correctly identifies that the renewal fee must be paid separately to each state and mentions the grace period, its last date for valid payment without an additional fee (16 January 2024) is incorrect. The correct latest date would be January 9, 2024, considering a typical two-month delay between grant decision and EPB publication.\n",

      "Justification: - Explanation of why A is correct: In oral proceedings where the opposition division decides to maintain the patent with amendments that include handwritten changes in the description, it aligns with the guidelines that formal compliance is required for the entire description. The patent proprietor must pay the fee for publishing a new specification and file translations of the claims as part of the requirements to ensure that all documents are officially compliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Statement B incorrectly suggests that no further actions by the patent proprietor would be needed if an appeal were filed, which does not align with procedural standards. Even after filing an appeal, formal compliance remains a prerequisite for maintaining the patent in its amended form once finalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The opposition division typically does not issue an immediate invitation to pay fees and submit compliant versions together with the interlocutory decision itself. Instead, this step usually occurs post-decision as part of the formalities processing phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it may seem logical that upon request after no appeal is filed, the patent proprietor should comply within four months, the precise timing and nature of compliance requirements do not align with procedural norms.

      "Justification: - Explanation of why A is correct: Since amendments under Article 19 PCT were filed during the international phase after receiving a negative written opinion from the EPO acting as ISA, and no request for international preliminary examination was made (meaning no IPER), the amendments are considered part of the application. As Form 1200 was used without any further amendments upon entry into the European regional phase, a communication under Rules 161/162 will be received that states if there is no reply in time, the application will be deemed to be withdrawn (Form 1226AA). This form informs the applicant of the potential consequences and requires action within a given timeframe.\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Form 1226BB typically offers an opportunity to comment and file amendments but would not be issued in this scenario because there are no further actions needed if the earlier amendments (under Article 19 PCT) have already been accepted and are part of the application.\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Form 1226CC offers the opportunity to file amendments before the supplementary European search report is drawn up, but it would not be issued since no further amendments were filed upon entry into the regional phase, and the earlier amendments are already considered part of the application.\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Form 1226AC states that examination has started. However, this form does not apply in this situation because a negative written opinion was received from the EPO acting as ISA, and no further actions (such as filing new amendments) were taken upon entry into the European regional phase.

Rule 165(2) requires that any amendments must be understood by the EPO officials and thus need a proper English translation, but this does not mean Korhonen must first file in Finnish and then separately translate; he can provide it directly or ensure a timely translation is submitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Korhonen is allowed to file amended claims in Finnish because Rule 70(1) permits the filing in the language of the application if it’s an official language of one of the contracting states, which Finnish is. Hence, he is not prohibited from using Finnish for his amendments as long as a translation into English follows within the specified period.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: D\n",
      "Answer: D\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why D is correct. PCT Direct is not available on condition that amended claims are filed with the PCT Direct letter, in a single PDF document. The process for PCT Direct does not require or include filing amended claims alongside the informal comments aimed at overcoming objections raised in the search opinion.\n",
      "- Explanation of why B, C, and A are incorrect:  \n",
      "  - Option A is correct because PCT Direct can be used when the priority application and international application are both filed in French (Belgian/French) and processed through ePCT-Filing. \n",
      "  - Option B is correct as long as the EP application has been searched by the EPO, even if the subsequent international application is filed in English.\n",
      "  - Option C is correct because when the priority application is an already-searched PCT application with the EPO and both applications are filed in English using Online Filing 2.0, it qualifies for PCT Direct.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Final answer: D\n",
      "Answer: D\n",
      "Justification: - Explanation of why D is correct. According to Article 6(1) Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 and Rule 6(2)(d) UPR, the translation may be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU, except English, irrespective of the language in which the application was filed or the geographical extent of the unitary effect. Spanish is one of the 24 official languages of the EU and thus can be used for this purpose.\n",
      "- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Statement B incorrectly limits the choice to an official language of any of the 18 states, rather than any of the 24 official languages of the entire EU.\n",
      "- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Although it mentions the correct number (24) of official languages, it incorrectly associates this with the UPCA (Unified Patent Court Agreement), which does not determine the language requirements for translations under Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012.\n",
      "- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Dutch cannot be used as a translation since Mr Linguist already filed the application in Dutch and English was chosen as the language of proceedings. The regulation requires a new translation into one of the EU's official languages, except for English which cannot be reused here since it was only used for proceedings purposes.\n",
