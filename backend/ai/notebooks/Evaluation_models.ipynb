      "```json\n",
      "{\n",
      "    \"Answer\": \"B\",\n",
      "    \"Justification\": \"According to the rules for PCT Direct as outlined in the provided legal text, option B is not correct because it involves filing an international application in a language different from that used in the priority application. Specifically, the text indicates that 'PCT Direct may be requested by the applicant if the priority application and the subsequent international application are filed in the same language (e.g., both in English or both in French) using ePCT-Filing or Online Filing 2.0.' This directly rules out option B since it mentions filing an international application in English, whereas the search opinion was raised on a priority application that is not explicitly stated to be in any of these languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation for why other options are incorrect:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Option A: While this scenario might seem plausible due to the use of ePCT-Filing and the language being French (one of the official languages), it does not meet the criteria for PCT Direct because the priority application is a Belgian application. According to the text, PCT Direct is only available if both applications are filed in one of the EPO's official languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Option C: This scenario fits the eligibility requirements for PCT Direct as described in the provided legal text. Both the priority and subsequent international applications are filed in English, which is an official language of the EPO, thus meeting the necessary criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Option D: Amended claims being required with a PCT Direct letter does not disqualify it from being eligible; rather, this could be seen as a procedural requirement that might apply regardless. The primary issue lies in the language compatibility and method of filing which are the central points for eligibility to use PCT Direct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, option B is incorrect based on the provided legal text's requirements for PCT Direct's application.\"\n",

Which of the following statements is correct?', 'options': ['A. Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch', 'B. Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends', 'C. Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA', 'D.

      "```json\n",
      "{\n",
      "    \"Answer\": \"B\",\n",
      "    \"Justification\": \"According to the provisions outlined in the EPC and specifically as per J12/09 (OJ 2014, 683), for applications filed under the Unitary Patent system, a translation into an official language of any state that has implemented the UPCA must be provided when requesting unitary effect. This means that if Mr Linguist wants immediate registration of the unitary effect, he should ensure the translation is in one of these languages.\\n\\n- **Option A** states Dutch. While the application was filed in Dutch, not all European countries have Dutch as an official language. Thus, this option does not necessarily meet the requirement for a language that has implemented the UPCA.\\n\\n- **Option C** mentions 24 states, which is incorrect because only 18 states are currently signatories to the Unitary Patent Package and have fully implemented it.\\n\\n- **Option D** suggests providing a translation into Spanish. While Spain is one of the member states under the UPCA, Spanish is not an official language that must be used for translations according to the relevant EPC provisions mentioned.\\n\\nTherefore, Option B is correct as it aligns with the legal requirements for immediate registration of unitary effect under the Unitary Patent system.\"\n",
