What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2.

    "    **Question**: \"What conditions must be met for a contract to be voidable due to duress under the Civil Code?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - A contract may be voidable if one party was under duress, but this duress must be severe enough to impair the will of the affected party. According to Article 123 of the Civil Code, duress must be such that the affected party was left with no free choice in entering the contract.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article defines duress and explicitly ties the concept to the condition that it must be severe enough to affect free will. The wording \"so severe\" emphasizes that the severity of duress is a key factor in determining the validity of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Question**: \"Can a contract be voidable due to lack of consent?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - Yes, under the Civil Code, a contract may be voidable if one party lacked the capacity to give consent. This includes situations where the individual was unable to understand the nature of the contract. Article 123 of the Civil Code outlines that contracts entered into by individuals lacking the legal capacity to understand the terms are voidable.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract is voidable when one party lacks the legal capacity to understand the terms of the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article provides the legal basis for the voidability of a contract when consent is impaired due to the lack of understanding, which directly addresses the question about lack of consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Example Legal Texts:\n",
    "    - **Legal Text 1**: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",
    "    - **Legal Text 2**: \"A contract is voidable when one party lacks the legal capacity to understand the terms of the agreement, as specified in Article 123 of the Civil Code.\"\n",

Do you mind explaining which section or example you’re referring to? For instance, are you curious about the notary’s role in document disclosure (Section C.3.4.13) or how features contribute to solving a problem for assessing inventive step (Section D.9.6)?\n",
      "\n",
      "If it's the notary’s role, let's break down why “D” might not be correct based on **T 1553/06**. The board in that case determined that the notary was not considered part of the public because they lacked the right to disclose the document’s content. This means the technical knowledge or expertise of a notary is irrelevant in this context, as the board explicitly stated it doesn’t matter whether the notary has the necessary understanding of the document's content.\n",

      "If you're referring to **Section D.9.6** on features contributing to the solution, we need to understand that only those claimed features which contribute causally to solving the problem are relevant for assessing inventive step. Features that do not add value or solve the stated technical problem should be excluded from consideration (as per T 574/92).\n",
      "\n",
      "So if you were considering answer D as correct, it might have been about assuming a feature’s contribution without proper evidence.

      "Thank you for the detailed feedback and the correct answers. Could you provide a bit more context on why it's important to file the translation within one month? What could be the potential consequences if this deadline is missed beyond just the application being deemed withdrawn? Certainly! Filing the translation of an international patent application within the specified timeframe, typically one month after entry into the European phase, is crucial for several reasons and can have broader implications beyond just the application being deemed withdrawn.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Importance of Timely Translation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistency and Clarity**: The primary purpose of translating the application documents (original text and claims) into an official language is to ensure consistency and clarity in communication between the applicant and the EPO. This helps avoid any misunderstandings that could arise from multiple languages being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Legal Compliance**: Filing the translation within the specified timeframe ensures compliance with the procedural rules of the European Patent Office, which are designed to maintain order and efficiency in the patent examination process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Efficiency of Examination**: The timely submission of translations allows the Examining Division to begin their work without delays, thereby ensuring a smooth and efficient examination process. Delaying this step can disrupt the workflow and potentially extend the overall timeline for obtaining a European patent.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cost Implications**: Some countries or regions within Europe may have different fees associated with filing applications in their official languages. Missing the translation deadline might lead to additional costs, such as late payment penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **International Cooperation**: The European Patent Office works closely with other national and regional offices. Timely submission of translations ensures that there is no disruption in the international cooperation necessary for obtaining patent protection across multiple jurisdictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Consequences Beyond Deemed Withdrawal:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Delayed Examination Process**: If the translation is not submitted within the one-month period, the Examining Division may delay their examination process until the required documents are received. This could significantly extend the overall timeline for the application to be examined and granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Additional Fees or Penalties**: Depending on the specific rules of the EPO and local patent offices, there might be additional fees or penalties associated with late submission. These can add financial burden to the applicant and may impact their budget planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Impact on National Filings**: In many cases, national filings derived from a European patent application must also comply with language requirements. Missing the translation deadline could affect subsequent national filings in various countries, potentially leading to further complications or delays.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Loss of Rights**: The EPO may issue a notice of withdrawal and may start considering cancellation of the application if no timely correction is made. This can be particularly problematic for applicants who have invested significant resources into preparing their applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reputation and Credibility**: Failing to adhere to procedural rules might impact your reputation as an inventor or applicant, making it harder to work with the EPO in future applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Filing the translation of a non-official language application within one month after entry into the European phase is not just about avoiding withdrawal but also ensuring efficient processing, compliance with legal requirements, and maintaining a smooth workflow. Missing this deadline can have broader implications that extend beyond the initial application process.\n",

      "Hey there! It sounds like you're looking for a bit more detail on how use claims work in patent applications. Let's break this down together.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Claims\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, let’s address your question about \"use\" claims. The guidelines clearly state that when you have a claim like “the use of substance X as an insecticide,” it is treated the same way as a process claim for “a process of killing insects using substance X.” This means the claim is focused on the act or method of using the substance, not necessarily the substance itself (unless specified with further details).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if you have a claim for \"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit,\" it's essentially saying that you're claiming the process where a transistor is used to amplify something. It doesn't mean you’re claiming every possible amplifying circuit or even specifying all steps involved in building such a circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Definition by Reference to Another Entity\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s move on to claims defining an entity based on its use with another related but separate entity. For instance, take the claim “a cylinder head for an engine.” Here, you’re not necessarily claiming the entire engine itself; rather, you're focusing on features of the cylinder head that make it suitable for installation in a specific type of engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to F-IV, 4.14, such claims are often allowed because the cylinder head can be produced and marketed independently of the engine. This means the subject-matter is the cylinder head itself, not including the whole engine unless there's no doubt that you’re referring to both entities together.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, if your claim reads: \"a cylinder head for an engine having a specific design,\" it's generally understood that this is about the cylinder head’s design and its suitability with the engine described in the claim. The features of the engine are not limiting unless explicitly stated (like saying \"an engine comprising a cylinder head\").\n",
      "\n",
      "### When to Include Features from the Other Entity\n",
      "\n",
      "The key point here is that if you want the features of the other entity (like the engine) to be part of your subject-matter, you need to make it clear. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If you say “a cylinder head and an engine with a specific design,” then both components are considered as part of the claimed invention.\n",
      "- But in a claim like \"a cylinder head for an engine,\" only features that ensure compatibility or suitability are relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Computer-Implemented Inventions\n",
      "\n",
      "For computer-implemented inventions, there’s another section (F-IV, 3.9) where claims to a computer program might refer to a separate computer. This is a bit different from the examples you provided but still important if your invention involves software and hardware interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Resources\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need more details or want to explore specific sections, feel free to ask! The EPO Guidelines for Examination (GFE) are quite detailed, and sometimes it helps to look at real-world examples. You can also find sample claims in the GFE that might help illustrate these points further.\n",
