What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2.

    "    **Question**: \"What conditions must be met for a contract to be voidable due to duress under the Civil Code?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - A contract may be voidable if one party was under duress, but this duress must be severe enough to impair the will of the affected party. According to Article 123 of the Civil Code, duress must be such that the affected party was left with no free choice in entering the contract.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article defines duress and explicitly ties the concept to the condition that it must be severe enough to affect free will. The wording \"so severe\" emphasizes that the severity of duress is a key factor in determining the validity of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Question**: \"Can a contract be voidable due to lack of consent?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - Yes, under the Civil Code, a contract may be voidable if one party lacked the capacity to give consent. This includes situations where the individual was unable to understand the nature of the contract. Article 123 of the Civil Code outlines that contracts entered into by individuals lacking the legal capacity to understand the terms are voidable.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract is voidable when one party lacks the legal capacity to understand the terms of the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article provides the legal basis for the voidability of a contract when consent is impaired due to the lack of understanding, which directly addresses the question about lack of consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Example Legal Texts:\n",
    "    - **Legal Text 1**: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",
    "    - **Legal Text 2**: \"A contract is voidable when one party lacks the legal capacity to understand the terms of the agreement, as specified in Article 123 of the Civil Code.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "However, since Option D is not listed among the choices provided in the question, and given that the correct answer should fall within this timeframe, we can deduce:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The correct choice from the available options is **Option A**, which states: \"File the request by 15 September 2023 and pay the further processing fee, as per Rule 70(1).\"\n",

      "### Ambiguity and Insufficiency Under Art. 83\n",
      "- **Art. 83 (Sufficiency of disclosure)**: The claims must be sufficiently disclosed so that a person skilled in the art can carry out the invention without undue burden.\n",
      "- **Insufficiency**: If an ambiguity makes it impossible to carry out the entire scope of the claim, then Art. 83 might apply.\n",

      "### Ambiguity and Scope Under Art. 84\n",
      "- **Art. 84 (Clarity)**: The claims must be clear and concise.\n",
      "- **Ambiguity in Claims**: If an ambiguity does not affect the whole scope of the claim or if it doesn’t render the invention unworkable, then typically a sufficiency objection under Art. 83 would not arise. Instead, a clarity issue might be raised under Art. 84.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example from T 608/07 and T 1811/13\n",
      "- **T 608/07**: If the ambiguity makes it impossible to carry out any part of the invention defined in the claim, then an objection under Art. 83 might be appropriate.\n",
      "- **T 1811/13**: Otherwise, a sufficiency issue is more likely to fall under Art. 84.\n",
      "\n",

      "- **Expression of Preference (\"preferably\", \"for example\")**: These terms are allowed if they don't introduce ambiguity.\n",
      "- **Art. 84 Compliance**: If the optional features do not lead to a restriction that makes the claim unclear or ambiguous, then they should be regarded as entirely optional.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Notary Case Law (C.3.4.13)\n",
      "- In T 1553/06: The board ruled that a notary is not considered part of the public and does not have the right to disclose the document's content. Therefore, their technical knowledge in understanding it is irrelevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Option A Might Be Incorrect\n",
      "If option A suggests something about clarity or sufficiency being always tied directly with each other, then it might be incorrect because:\n",
      "- **Art. 83 (Sufficiency)**: Focuses on whether a person skilled in the art can carry out the invention.\n",
      "- **Art. 84 (Clarity)**: Focuses on making sure the claims are clear and unambiguous.\n",

      " It sounds like you're interested in understanding how claims involving \"use\" and defining a physical entity by reference to another entity are handled during examination at the European Patent Office (EPO). Let's break this down step-by-step.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Claims\n",
      "\n",
      "When it comes to use claims, such as \"the use of substance X as an insecticide,\" these are essentially viewed as equivalent to process claims. Specifically, a use claim like this is interpreted as a process of killing insects using the substance X, not necessarily the substance itself in its final form (e.g., with additional additives). \n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "- **Claim:** \"The use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit.\"\n",
      "  - This is equivalent to: \"A process of amplifying using a circuit containing the transistor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that these claims are not interpreted as referring to the specific setup or the process of building such a circuit. The key here is understanding what the claim is really about.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Defining Physical Entities by Reference\n",
      "\n",
      "When defining a physical entity (like a product or apparatus) based on its use with another entity, you're essentially describing how it fits into a larger system. An example provided in the guidelines is:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Claim:** \"A cylinder head for an engine.\"\n",
      "  - This claim describes the cylinder head and defines some of its features by reference to where and how it's used—specifically within an engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this, we can infer that the cylinder head itself could be produced and sold independently. The patent protection here would generally cover just the cylinder head, unless there’s no doubt in the claim that you're referring to a combination of both entities (engine + cylinder head).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Points from F-IV 4.14:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Independent Protection**: The first entity can often be produced and marketed independently of the other entity. This means the cylinder head could be patented separately even if it's designed for use with a specific engine.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Interpretation by Reference**:\n",
      "   - **Example Claim:** \"A cylinder head for an engine.\"\n",
      "     - Here, the features that define the cylinder head are related to its location and function within the engine. However, this does not limit the patent protection of the cylinder head itself unless there's clear intent to protect a combination.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Combination Claim**:\n",
      "   - If you want the engine features to be part of the claim’s subject matter (meaning both entities must be considered together), you would need to phrase it differently, such as \"An engine with a cylinder head\" or \"An engine comprising a cylinder head.\" In this case, the features of the engine are indeed limiting for the patent's scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Special Cases**:\n",
      "   - For claims involving computer-implemented inventions where a claim to a computer program refers to a computer (another entity), different considerations apply as mentioned in F-IV 3.9.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Clarification\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s consider an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Claim:** \"A cylinder head for an engine that allows improved fuel efficiency.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, the cylinder head is being defined by its use within the context of improving fuel efficiency in a specific type of engine. However, unless explicitly stated otherwise (like \"An engine with a cylinder head that improves fuel efficiency\"), this claim would not be interpreted as protecting the entire engine or limiting the scope to only those engines.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Encouraging Further Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any specific questions about how these claims are examined at the EPO? Or perhaps an example where you're unsure of the interpretation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Feel free to ask more detailed questions, and I'll do my best to clarify using relevant legal texts!\n",
