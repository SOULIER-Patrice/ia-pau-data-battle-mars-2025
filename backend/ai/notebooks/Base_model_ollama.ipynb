      " On 25  October 2019, the Spanish University Isabel  II and the company Tomato Matters filed a European patent application in Spanish, accompanied by a translation into English. Tomato Matters employs more than 260 employees.  The University Isabel  II has filed two patent applications with the EPO over the past five years. On 10 October 2024, Tomato Matters transfers its rights to Naranjas Navel , a company which employs 9 members of staff and whose annual turnover is EUR  1 million. Naranjas Navel has never filed any patent applications with the EPO.  In a communication from the EPO under Rule 71(3) EPC dated 10 October 2024, the name of the applicants is given as: Isabe  III (clerical error) and Tomato Matters.  1. What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2.

      "Certainly! Let's delve deeper into these aspects of claim drafting and examination as detailed in the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office (EPO).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Claims\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use claims** are claims directed to the use of a product or process for a particular purpose. For instance, claiming \"the use of substance X as an insecticide\" is treated equivalently to a process claim stating \"a process of killing insects using substance X.\" This interpretation ensures that such claims are not limited to specific forms of the product but rather focus on its intended application.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Example 1:** A claim for \"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit\" can be seen as equivalent to a process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the transistor. This prevents the interpretation that such a claim covers only circuits specifically designed with this particular configuration.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Example 2:** Conversely, if you have a claim like \"the use of a process for manufacturing a specific type of pharmaceutical,\" it is interpreted as equivalent to a product claim directed to the manufactured product itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more details and case law support, refer to **T 684/02**. This case confirms that such claims should be understood in terms of their intended application rather than the physical form or configuration of the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Definition by Reference to Another Entity\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims can sometimes define a product (or apparatus) by referring to another entity with which it is used, but not necessarily part of it. For example, \"a cylinder head for an engine\" describes the cylinder head based on its location and features in relation to the engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Independent Protection:** In many cases, this first entity can be produced and marketed independently of the second entity (e.g., a cylinder head can be sold without the entire engine). Therefore, claims defining such entities are often interpreted as being independent unless there is clear indication that they must work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** The claim \"a cylinder head for an engine\" means that the features of the engine do not limit the subject matter of the claim per se. However, if the claim clearly states something like \"an engine comprising a cylinder head,\" then the features of the engine would be limiting to the scope of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "For detailed guidance and case law references, see **F-IV, 4.14**. This section explains that such claims should not include the other entity or its features unless there is no doubt that both entities must work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "### References:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Use Claims:** [T 684/02](https://ep.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?PubNr=3751464)\n",

      "User message:\n",
      "Explain me with more details and references.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chat answer:\n",
      "Certainly! Let's delve deeper into these aspects of claim drafting and examination as detailed in the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office (EPO).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Use Claims\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use claims** are claims directed to the use of a product or process for a particular purpose. For instance, claiming \"the use of substance X as an insecticide\" is treated equivalently to a process claim stating \"a process of killing insects using substance X.\" This interpretation ensures that such claims are not limited to specific forms of the product but rather focus on its intended application.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Example 1:** A claim for \"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit\" can be seen as equivalent to a process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the transistor. This prevents the interpretation that such a claim covers only circuits specifically designed with this particular configuration.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Example 2:** Conversely, if you have a claim like \"the use of a process for manufacturing a specific type of pharmaceutical,\" it is interpreted as equivalent to a product claim directed to the manufactured product itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more details and case law support, refer to **T 684/02**. This case confirms that such claims should be understood in terms of their intended application rather than the physical form or configuration of the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Definition by Reference to Another Entity\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims can sometimes define a product (or apparatus) by referring to another entity with which it is used, but not necessarily part of it. For example, \"a cylinder head for an engine\" describes the cylinder head based on its location and features in relation to the engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Independent Protection:** In many cases, this first entity can be produced and marketed independently of the second entity (e.g., a cylinder head can be sold without the entire engine). Therefore, claims defining such entities are often interpreted as being independent unless there is clear indication that they must work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:** The claim \"a cylinder head for an engine\" means that the features of the engine do not limit the subject matter of the claim per se. However, if the claim clearly states something like \"an engine comprising a cylinder head,\" then the features of the engine would be limiting to the scope of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "For detailed guidance and case law references, see **F-IV, 4.14**. This section explains that such claims should not include the other entity or its features unless there is no doubt that both entities must work together.\n",
      "\n",
      "### References:\n",
