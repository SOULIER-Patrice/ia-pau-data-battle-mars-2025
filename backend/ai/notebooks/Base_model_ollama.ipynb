    "    **Question**: \"What conditions must be met for a contract to be voidable due to duress under the Civil Code?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - A contract may be voidable if one party was under duress, but this duress must be severe enough to impair the will of the affected party. According to Article 123 of the Civil Code, duress must be such that the affected party was left with no free choice in entering the contract.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article defines duress and explicitly ties the concept to the condition that it must be severe enough to affect free will. The wording \"so severe\" emphasizes that the severity of duress is a key factor in determining the validity of the contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Question**: \"Can a contract be voidable due to lack of consent?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Answer**:\n",
    "    - Yes, under the Civil Code, a contract may be voidable if one party lacked the capacity to give consent. This includes situations where the individual was unable to understand the nature of the contract. Article 123 of the Civil Code outlines that contracts entered into by individuals lacking the legal capacity to understand the terms are voidable.\n",
    "    - **Source**: Article 123 of the Civil Code states: \"A contract is voidable when one party lacks the legal capacity to understand the terms of the agreement.\"\n",
    "    - **Explanation of Relevance**: This article provides the legal basis for the voidability of a contract when consent is impaired due to the lack of understanding, which directly addresses the question about lack of consent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Example Legal Texts:\n",
    "    - **Legal Text 1**: \"A contract may be voidable if it was entered into under duress, provided that the duress was so severe that it compromised the free will of the affected party.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "The user selected **Answer D**, which states: \"Amendments can be made at any time before the grant of the patent.\" This is incorrect based on the given information and the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Correct Answer**: The correct answer is **B. Amendments can be made both in the international and European phases, provided they are consistent with the original filing date.**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Legal Context**:\n",
      "   - According to Article 123(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), any amendments must not extend the scope of protection conferred by the application as filed.\n",
      "   - Article 123(3) of the EPC states that no amendment may add subject-matter or modify the content of the claims in a way which extends the protection sought in respect of the prior art.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis of User's Answer (D)\n",
      "- **Option D** is incorrect because it suggests amendments can be made at any time before the grant of the patent. This is too broad and does not align with the strict conditions set forth by Articles 123(2) and 123(3) of the EPC, which limit when and how amendments can be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correct Answer (B)\n",
      "- **Option B** correctly states that amendments can be made both during the international phase and when the application enters the European phase. However, it includes a critical caveat: these amendments must be consistent with the original filing date.\n",
      "- According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.7, amendments are allowed in the international phase as well as in the European phase, provided they comply with Article 123(2) and (3). This means that any amendment must not extend the scope of protection sought beyond what was originally disclosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Information\n",
      "- **Late Receipt**: The information about late receipt of documents is from Rule 133(1), which states that if a document was sent to a recognized postal service provider at least five days before its due date and received within three months, it will be deemed timely. This does not relate directly to the amendment question but provides context on how deadlines can be extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The correct answer is **B** because amendments must be consistent with the original filing date as required by Articles 123(2) and (3) of the EPC, which apply during both the international phase and the European phase. The user’s answer of D was incorrect due to its overly broad statement about when amendments can occur.\n",

      " It seems like you're a bit confused about why option A isn't correct. Let's break it down together using the information provided in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO and some additional context from your other sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I understand, we have three main points here:\n",
      "1. **Ambiguity and Sufficiency of Disclosure**: The first text discusses how ambiguity can affect claims but primarily relates to Art. 84 (clarity) rather than Art. 83 (sufficiency of disclosure). According to the guidelines, if an ambiguity doesn't make it impossible to carry out all aspects of the invention defined in a claim, then you should raise an objection under Art. 84 instead.\n",
      "2. **Optional Features**: The second text explains that optional features like \"preferably,\" \"for example,\" or \"such as\" are allowed if they don’t introduce ambiguity. These terms can make claims clearer by offering alternative embodiments but must not be contradictory within themselves.\n",
      "3. **Notary as Member of the Public**: The third text discusses a board decision stating that a notary is not considered part of the public for the purposes of assessing whether someone has the necessary knowledge to understand a document.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these points, let's say you have an ambiguity in your claims and are considering whether it affects sufficiency or clarity. Here’s why option A (which I'm assuming refers to a specific scenario where the ambiguity directly impacts the ability to perform the invention) might not be correct:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the ambiguity makes it impossible to carry out at least part of the claimed invention, this would indeed affect its sufficiency under Art. 83.\n",
      "- However, if the ambiguity is just about understanding which features are included in the claim but doesn’t prevent any aspect of the invention from being carried out, then an objection should be raised under Art. 84 (clarity).\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, let’s say you have a claim with an ambiguous parameter like \"a material that can be plastic or metal.\" If someone could figure out which material they are working with, the claim is still clear enough to understand and follow. This would likely lead to an objection under Art. 84 rather than Art. 83.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding your specific case where a notary isn’t considered part of the public for understanding documents, it’s important to recognize that this decision doesn’t directly impact the sufficiency or clarity of claims but may influence other aspects such as confidentiality and disclosure.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still feel confused about any specific section or have more questions on these topics, please let me know! I’m here to help clarify things further.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the information provided in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Languages for Filing:**\n",
      "   - According to Rule 6(3) of the Guidelines, an application filed in a non-official language (such as Japanese) will be accepted by the EPO, and the applicant will have to provide a translation into one of the official languages within the specified timeframe.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Translation Submission Deadline:**\n",
      "   - The translation must be submitted within two months from the filing date of the application according to Rule 6(1). Since the Japanese application was filed on March 15, 2023, the deadline for submitting a translation would be May 14, 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consequences of Failing to File Translation:**\n",
      "   - If the translation is not provided by the specified deadline and Rule 58 is invoked, the application may be deemed withdrawn according to Art. 14(2) as per Rule 6(1). This can be seen from the relevant text in A-VII, 1.1:\n",
      "     - \"If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency underRule 58 within two months in accordance with the procedure explained inA-III, 16.\"\n",
      "   - Further, if the application is deemed withdrawn due to non-compliance, Rule 112(1) dictates that the EPO will notify the applicant of this loss of rights.\n",
      "     - \"The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1).\"\n",

      " Hello! It sounds like you're interested in understanding more about claims that define an invention by reference to another entity through use. Let's break this down step-by-step using some examples from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Definition by Reference to Another Entity\n",
      "\n",
      "In a situation where a claim is directed towards a physical entity (like a cylinder head), but its definition depends on features related to another entity that it's used with, you need to be clear about what exactly your invention encompasses. For instance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Claim Example:** \"A cylinder head for an engine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "  In this case, the cylinder head is being defined based on how it fits or functions within the context of an engine.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interpreting the Claim\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look at how this claim might be interpreted by someone examining your patent application. The key points to consider are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Independence of Entities:** \n",
      "   - Since the cylinder head can often be produced and sold separately from the engine, it is typically treated as a standalone invention.\n",
      "   - This means that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the claim will not include the features of the engine itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Features Suitability:**\n",
      "   - The cylinder head must still meet specific requirements to function properly within the described engine (e.g., it needs to fit correctly and perform its intended purpose).\n",
      "   - However, these engine-specific features do not limit the scope of protection for the cylinder head per se; they merely ensure that it functions as intended when used in a particular engine design.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Combination Claims:**\n",
      "   - If you want the features of the other entity (like an engine) to be considered part of the claimed invention, then your claim should explicitly state this.\n",
      "   - For instance, instead of saying \"a cylinder head for an engine,\" you might write something like:\n",
      "     - \"An engine comprising a cylinder head with [specific features].\"\n",
      "     - This makes it clear that both entities are being combined and that the engine’s characteristics do limit the scope of protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example from EPO Guidelines\n",
      "\n",
      "From the text provided, we can see this is explicitly stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "> Since the first entity (the cylinder head) can often be produced and marketed independently of the other entity (the engine), the applicant is normally entitled to independent protection of the first entity per se. Therefore, in first instance, such a claim is always interpreted as not including the other entity or its features: these limit the subject-matter of the claim only in so far as the first entity's features are suitable to be used with the second entity's features.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Computer-Implemented Inventions\n",
      "\n",
      "For claims involving computer-implemented inventions where a software program interacts with hardware (another entity), you should follow similar principles. For example, if your claim refers to both a computer and a software program, ensure it is clear whether the computer itself forms part of the claimed invention or just serves as an environment for running the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Further Reading\n",
      "\n",
      "For more detailed guidance on these concepts, I recommend checking out the relevant sections in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **F-IV, 4.14:** Definition by reference to another entity\n",
      "- **F-IV, 3.9:** Claims directed to computer-implemented inventions (for cases where a claim refers to both software and hardware)\n",
      "\n",
