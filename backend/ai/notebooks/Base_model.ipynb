On 10 October 2024, Tomato Matters transfers its rights to Naranjas Navel , a company which employs 9 members of staff and whose annual turnover is EUR  1 million. Naranjas Navel has never filed any patent applications with the EPO.  In a communication from the EPO under Rule 71(3) EPC dated 10 October 2024, the name of the applicants is given as: Isabe  III (clerical error) and Tomato Matters.  1. What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2.

      "Feedback:\n",
      "**Feedback:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The user's answer is completely incorrect and does not address the specific questions asked. Here’s a detailed explanation of why the user's answer is wrong and how it relates to the provided context:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Context Analysis:\n",
      "The user's confusion seems to stem from misunderstanding the conditions for filing translations and the fees applicable to European patent applications. Let's break down the key points from the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Translation Requirements**: According to Article 14(2) of the EPC, documents that need to be filed within a time limit must be filed in an admissible non-EPO language. Additionally, there is a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants starting from April 1, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Application Filing**: The user mentions that a European patent application was filed in Japanese in January 2022. Since the application was filed after April 1, 2014, the applicant qualifies for the 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Translation Requirement**: The user incorrectly states that the applicant should file the documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non-EPO language within two months of filing the European patent application. This is incorrect because the application needs to be filed in an admissible non-EPO language first, and then the documents can be filed within the specified time limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fee Reduction**: The user correctly identifies that there is a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants starting from April 1, 2014. They also mention that the applicant should file the translation of the previous application within the time limits mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correct Answer:\n",
      "To summarize, the correct answers are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non-EPO language**: These should be filed within two months of filing the European patent application.\n",
      "- **Translation of the previous application**: This should be filed within one month of filing the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The user's answer is entirely off-topic and fails to address the specific requirements related to filing translations and applying for reductions in fees. It is crucial to understand the legal framework governing patent filings and translations to avoid confusion and ensure compliance with the regulations.\n",

      "\n",
      "The user's answer is completely incorrect and does not address the specific questions asked. Here’s a detailed explanation of why the user's answer is wrong and how it relates to the provided context:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Context Analysis:\n",
      "The user's confusion seems to stem from misunderstanding the conditions for filing translations and the fees applicable to European patent applications. Let's break down the key points from the context:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Translation Requirements**: According to Article 14(2) of the EPC, documents that need to be filed within a time limit must be filed in an admissible non-EPO language. Additionally, there is a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants starting from April 1, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Application Filing**: The user mentions that a European patent application was filed in Japanese in January 2022. Since the application was filed after April 1, 2014, the applicant qualifies for the 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Translation Requirement**: The user incorrectly states that the applicant should file the documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non-EPO language within two months of filing the European patent application. This is incorrect because the application needs to be filed in an admissible non-EPO language first, and then the documents can be filed within the specified time limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fee Reduction**: The user correctly identifies that there is a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants starting from April 1, 2014. They also mention that the applicant should file the translation of the previous application within the time limits mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Correct Answer:\n",
      "To summarize, the correct answers are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non-EPO language**: These should be filed within two months of filing the European patent application.\n",
      "- **Translation of the previous application**: This should be filed within one month of filing the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The user's answer is entirely off-topic and fails to address the specific requirements related to filing translations and applying for reductions in fees. It is crucial to understand the legal framework governing patent filings and translations to avoid confusion and ensure compliance with the regulations.\n",

      "Chat answer:\n",
      "Certainly! To clarify the situation regarding the filing and translation requirements for a European patent application filed in Japanese, let's delve deeper into the guidelines and rules outlined in the EPO's Guidelines for Examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Article 14(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee is available for certain categories of applicants. This reduction becomes applicable once the application is filed in an admissible non-EPO language. \n",
      "\n",
      "For a European patent application filed in a non-EPO language, the applicant must file the translation within two months of the filing date. This ensures that the application complies with the formal requirements set forth in the EPC. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down the steps involved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Filing the Application in Japanese**: The application was filed in Japanese, which is an official EPO language. As per Article 14(2), the applicant must file the translation within two months of the filing date.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Filing the Translation**: Once the translation is prepared and verified, it must be submitted to the EPO within the stipulated timeframe. This ensures that the application meets the formal requirements necessary for examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Requesting Examination**: After submitting the translation, the applicant can proceed with requesting examination. This step is optional but recommended to expedite the examination process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Fees and Reductions**: The applicant is eligible for a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fees if the application is filed in an admissible non-EPO language. This reduction is valid from April 1, 2014 onwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, the applicant ensures that the application is compliant with the EPC requirements and maximizes the benefits of the reduction in fees. The guidelines emphasize the importance of adhering to the deadlines and providing accurate translations to avoid delays and potential penalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "This comprehensive approach guarantees that the application is properly structured and ready for examination, thereby increasing the chances of obtaining a patent in a timely manner.\n",
