If they were met on different dates, the transfer would only have effect vis-à-vis the EPO at the date on which all the requirements mentioned above were fulfilled. InJ 38/92andJ 39/92the Legal Board of Appeal ruled that a transfer could only be recorded in the European Patent Register on the basis of an official document in accordance withR. 20(1) EPC 1973if that documentdirectlyverified the transfer (similarlyJ 4/10). It did not suffice if a judgment was submitted which mentioned another document from which it was possible to verify the transfer. In appeal proceedings, assessing whether there are documents satisfying the EPO that a transfer has taken place in accordance withR. 20(1)and(3) EPC 1973and recording the transfer in the Register is a matter for the department of first instance responsible for making the entry in the Register. Accordingly, in appeal proceedings, substitution of another party for the original applicant is possible only once the relevant department of first instance has made the entry or where there is clear-cut evidence of a transfer (J 26/95,OJ 1999, 668; see alsoT 976/97,T 1751/07). InT 393/15the board held that evidence of a transfer could not be regarded as clear-cut if the person carrying out the transfer had not been clearly authorised to do so (see alsoT 581/14). A transfer can be recorded in the European Patent Register even after deemed withdrawal of a patent application, if it is still possible that restitutio is available and the successor in title has taken, together with his request for registering the transfer, procedural steps suitable for restoring the application (J 10/93,OJ 1997, 91). InJ 17/12the Legal Board held that the transfer of a European patent application may not be recorded in the European Patent Register at a time when proceedings for the grant of the application are stayed underR. 14(1) EPC \n",
