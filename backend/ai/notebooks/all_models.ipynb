If they were met on different dates, the transfer would only have effect vis-à-vis the EPO at the date on which all the requirements mentioned above were fulfilled. InJ 38/92andJ 39/92the Legal Board of Appeal ruled that a transfer could only be recorded in the European Patent Register on the basis of an official document in accordance withR. 20(1) EPC 1973if that documentdirectlyverified the transfer (similarlyJ 4/10). It did not suffice if a judgment was submitted which mentioned another document from which it was possible to verify the transfer. In appeal proceedings, assessing whether there are documents satisfying the EPO that a transfer has taken place in accordance withR. 20(1)and(3) EPC 1973and recording the transfer in the Register is a matter for the department of first instance responsible for making the entry in the Register. Accordingly, in appeal proceedings, substitution of another party for the original applicant is possible only once the relevant department of first instance has made the entry or where there is clear-cut evidence of a transfer (J 26/95,OJ 1999, 668; see alsoT 976/97,T 1751/07). InT 393/15the board held that evidence of a transfer could not be regarded as clear-cut if the person carrying out the transfer had not been clearly authorised to do so (see alsoT 581/14). A transfer can be recorded in the European Patent Register even after deemed withdrawal of a patent application, if it is still possible that restitutio is available and the successor in title has taken, together with his request for registering the transfer, procedural steps suitable for restoring the application (J 10/93,OJ 1997, 91).

      "\n",
      "### Question 1: Why it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 and what steps must be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reason**: Although EP1 was filed without claiming priority from CN1, the priority claim can still be made because the priority claim can be made up to 16 months from the earliest priority date. Given that CN1 was filed on 31 August 2023, the earliest priority date would be 31 December 2023, extending to 2 January 2024. Therefore, the priority claim can still be made until 16 months later, which is 10 October 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Steps Required**:\n",
      "  1. File a declaration of priority indicating:\n",
      "     - The date of the previous application (CN1)\n",
      "     - The state or WTO member in or for which it was filed (China)\n",
      "     - The application number (CN1)\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. Pay the necessary fees for declaring priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 2: How to correct the issue with the description of another application instead of the priority application translated into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Correction Steps**:\n",
      "  1. Correct the mistake by translating the description of the priority application into English.\n",
      "  2. Submit the corrected version of the description along with the original application.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effect on Filing Date**:\n",
      "  - The filing date remains unchanged at 2 September 2024 since the priority claim was not made incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 3: Consequence regarding claiming priority from CN1 and actions that could be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Consequences**:\n",
      "  - The priority claim from CN1 cannot be made because it was not claimed when the application was initially filed.\n",
      "  - This means EP1 cannot benefit from the priority date of CN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Actions**:\n",
      "  - The applicant needs to file a declaration of priority indicating the correct details of CN1.\n",
      "  - They need to pay the necessary fees for declaring priority.\n",
      "  - The applicant should ensure that future filings correctly reflect the priority claim from CN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the priority claim from CN1 cannot be made due to the initial filing error, the applicant can rectify this by making the necessary declarations and payments.\n",

The previous application may have been filed in or for the same or different states or members of the WTO, but in all cases the earliest application must have been filed not more than 12 months before the date of filing of the European application. Subject-matter of a European application will be accorded the priority date of the earliest priority application which discloses it. If, for instance, the European application describes and claims two embodiments (A and B) of an invention, A being disclosed in a French application and B in a German application, both filed within the preceding 12 months, the priority dates of both the French and German applications may be claimed for the appropriate parts of the European application; embodiment A will have the French priority date and embodiment B the German priority date as effective dates. If embodiments A and B are claimed as alternatives in one claim, these alternatives will likewise have the different priority dates as effective dates. If, on the other hand, a European application is based on one previous application disclosing a feature C and a second previous application disclosing a feature D, neither disclosing the combination of C and D, a claim to that combination will be entitled only to the date of filing of the European application itself. In other words, it is not permitted to \"mosaic\" priority documents.

Where correct claims are filed underRule 56a(3)orRule 56a(4)(seeA‑II, 6), the claims fee is calculated on the basis of the set of claims first filed. The claims may be filed at the following stages: (a)on the filing date or on the date on which the divisional application is filed (seeA‑II, 4.1.5andA‑IV, 1.2.1) (b)after the filing date, in a timely response to a communication from the EPO indicating their absence underRule 58(seeA‑III, 15) (c)after the filing date, by applicants on their own initiative before the EPO sends a communication according toRule 58(seeA‑III, 15).

      "1. EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1 (31 August 2024, extended to 2 September\n",

      "\n",
      "### Question 1: Why it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 and what steps must be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Reason**: Although EP1 was filed without claiming priority from CN1, the priority claim can still be made because the priority claim can be made up to 16 months from the earliest priority date. Given that CN1 was filed on 31 August 2023, the earliest priority date would be 31 December 2023, extending to 2 January 2024. Therefore, the priority claim can still be made until 16 months later, which is 10 October 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Steps Required**:\n",
      "  1. File a declaration of priority indicating:\n",
      "     - The date of the previous application (CN1)\n",
      "     - The state or WTO member in or for which it was filed (China)\n",
      "     - The application number (CN1)\n",
      "\n",
      "  2. Pay the necessary fees for declaring priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 2: How to correct the issue with the description of another application instead of the priority application translated into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Correction Steps**:\n",
      "  1. Correct the mistake by translating the description of the priority application into English.\n",
      "  2. Submit the corrected version of the description along with the original application.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effect on Filing Date**:\n",
      "  - The filing date remains unchanged at 2 September 2024 since the priority claim was not made incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Question 3: Consequence regarding claiming priority from CN1 and actions that could be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Consequences**:\n",
      "  - The priority claim from CN1 cannot be made because it was not claimed when the application was initially filed.\n",
      "  - This means EP1 cannot benefit from the priority date of CN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Actions**:\n",
      "  - The applicant needs to file a declaration of priority indicating the correct details of CN1.\n",
      "  - They need to pay the necessary fees for declaring priority.\n",
      "  - The applicant should ensure that future filings correctly reflect the priority claim from CN1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the priority claim from CN1 cannot be made due to the initial filing error, the applicant can rectify this by making the necessary declarations and payments.\n",

Content: 1.5 Multiple priorities and partial priorities \"Multiple priorities may be claimed\" – i.e. a European application may claim rights of priority based on more than one previous application (G 2/98). \"Multiple priorities may be claimed\" – i.e. a European application may claim rights of priority based on more than one previous application (G 2/98). \"Partial priority\" refers to a situation in which only a part of the subject-matter encompassed by a generic \"OR\" claim is entitled to the priority date of a previous application (G 1/15). The previous application may have been filed in or for the same or different states or members of the WTO, but in all cases the earliest application must have been filed not more than 12 months before the date of filing of the European application. Subject-matter of a European application will be accorded the priority date of the earliest priority application which discloses it. If, for instance, the European application describes and claims two embodiments (A and B) of an invention, A being disclosed in a French application and B in a German application, both filed within the preceding 12 months, the priority dates of both the French and German applications may be claimed for the appropriate parts of the European application; embodiment A will have the French priority date and embodiment B the German priority date as effective dates. If embodiments A and B are claimed as alternatives in one claim, these alternatives will likewise have the different priority dates as effective dates. If, on the other hand, a European application is based on one previous application disclosing a feature C and a second previous application disclosing a feature D, neither disclosing the combination of C and D, a claim to that combination will be entitled only to the date of filing of the European application itself. In other words, it is not permitted to \"mosaic\" priority documents. An exception might arise where one priority document contains a reference to the other and explicitly states that features from the two documents can be combined in a particular manner \n",

      "To determine the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP), we need to analyze the guidelines provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. According to the guidelines, the renewal fee for the third year is due on the last day of the 31-month period starting from the filing date.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "A. 10 October 2024: This is the filing date, but it doesn't affect the timing of when the renewal fee becomes due.\n",
      "\n",

      "C. 18 October 2024: This is the day the debit order is scheduled to be executed. Since the renewal fee is not due until 20 May 2025, this is the latest point in time for revoking the order.\n",

If a debit order for a renewal fee is received via Central Fee Payment before the earliest valid payment dates underRule 51(1), it will be rejected at source by the validation functionality (seeA‑X, 4.2.3). If a payment is made too early either by filing a valid debit order via OLF and Online Filing 2.0 or by using any other payment method (i.e. bank transfer or credit card), the renewal fee will be refunded by the EPO according to the procedures laid down inA‑X, 10. Rule 51(1) If the renewal fee has not been validly paid on or before the due date, it may still be validly paid within six months of the said date, provided that the additional fee is paid within this period. The additional fee can be paid until the last day of the sixth month following the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing (seeJ 4/91, reasons 2.7). This six-month period begins on the last day of the month referred to inRule 51(1), first sentence, even if the circumstances described inRule 134(1),(2)and(5)apply.Rule 134is applicable to the calculation of the expiry of the six-month time limit for payment of the additional fee (seeJ 4/91, reasons 3.2). Whilst a notice draws the applicant's attention to the possibility underRule 51(2)andArt. 2(1), item 5, RFees, the omission of such notification may not be invoked (seeJ 12/84andJ 1/89).

This deferred due date, and hence the expiry of another period (the 31-month period), forms the basis for calculating the additional period for payment of the renewal fee with an additional fee (seeJ 1/89, the principles of which apply). For example: 20.04.2016 (Wed) Priority date 17.10.2016 (Mon) Filing date 31.10.2018 (Wed) Due date for third-year renewal fee underRule 51(1) 20.11.2018 (Tue) Expiry of 31-month period underRule 159(1)= deferred due date for third-year renewal fee 20.05.2019 (Mon) Last day for payment of the renewal fee (plus additional fee) since the six-month period underRule 51(2)expires that day If the applicant requests entry into the regional phase before the expiry of the 31-month period (seeArt. 23(2) PCTandArt. 40(2) PCT), in order for the request to become effective the renewal fee in respect of the third year has to be paid if the fee has fallen due earlier underRule 51(1). If the renewal fee is not paid on the date early processing is requested, the request for early processing will be effective only from the date on which the renewal fee is paid (and all further requirements necessary on the latter date have been complied with) (seeE‑IX, 2.8) \n",

Content: 4.2.4 Date of receipt of the debit order; insufficient funds Provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account on the date the EPO receives the debit order or on the execution date, that date will be considered the date on which the payment is made. Provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account on the date the EPO receives the debit order or on the execution date, that date will be considered the date on which the payment is made. This applies also where a debit order is filed together with an application filed underArt. 75(1)(b)with a competent national authority of a contracting state (seeA‑II, 1.6). If the EPO does not receive the debit order until after expiry of the period allowed for paying feesduewhich can be paidon filing, that period is deemed observed if evidence is available or presented to the EPO to show that the debit order was filed with the competent authority of the contracting state at the same time as the application, provided that sufficient funds were available in the account at the time the period expired.

In that case, the fee will be debited as indicated in the (erroneous) debit order or, if applicable, any corrective booking executed will be reverted. The principles outlined above, however, do not allow the correction of a debit order by adding any fee that is not indicated in it, even if, according to the status of proceedings, that fee is due on the date of receipt of the debit order. Point 10.2 ADA A debit order may be revoked in whole or in part by the person making the payment by sending a signed written notice tosupport@epo.orgby email or by completing the online contact form available on the EPO website (epo.org) and submitting it together with the signed written notice. For a debit order revocation notice to be effective, it must be received by the EPO no later than on the date on which the debit order is received. A debit order with deferred payment date may be revoked in Central Fee Payment until one day before the intended execution date or at the latest on the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to the EPO as indicated above. Point 13 ADA Payments via deposit account effected in Central Fee Payment are validated, meaning that the debit order for a fee is automatically rejected if the fee falls within one of the following categories: –renewal fees and fees for the transfer of rights made in respect of patent applications for which the loss of rights or the refusal has become final –renewal fees for granted European patents –renewal fees received before the earliest valid payment dates underRule 51(1) –double-payments for fees that can be paid only once in the proceedings before the EPO.
