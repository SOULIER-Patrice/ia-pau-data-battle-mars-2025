If they were met on different dates, the transfer would only have effect vis-Ã -vis the EPO at the date on which all the requirements mentioned above were fulfilled. InJÂ 38/92andJÂ 39/92the Legal Board of Appeal ruled that a transfer could only be recorded in the European Patent Register on the basis of an official document in accordance withR.Â 20(1)Â EPCÂ 1973if that documentdirectlyverified the transfer (similarlyJÂ 4/10). It did not suffice if a judgment was submitted which mentioned another document from which it was possible to verify the transfer. In appeal proceedings, assessing whether there are documents satisfying the EPO that a transfer has taken place in accordance withR.Â 20(1)and(3)Â EPCÂ 1973and recording the transfer in the Register is a matter for the department of first instance responsible for making the entry in the Register. Accordingly, in appeal proceedings, substitution of another party for the original applicant is possible only once the relevant department of first instance has made the entry or where there is clear-cut evidence of a transfer (JÂ 26/95,OJÂ 1999,Â 668; see alsoTÂ 976/97,TÂ 1751/07). InTÂ 393/15the board held that evidence of a transfer could not be regarded as clear-cut if the person carrying out the transfer had not been clearly authorised to do so (see alsoTÂ 581/14). A transfer can be recorded in the European Patent Register even after deemed withdrawal of a patent application, if it is still possible that restitutio is available and the successor in title has taken, together with his request for registering the transfer, procedural steps suitable for restoring the application (JÂ 10/93,OJÂ 1997,Â 91).

       "   'Question': \"  On 10 December 2021, your client, a large Romanian company, filed a Romanian national patent application RO-H. RO-H is drafted in Romanian and comprises 32 pages of description and drawings, and four pages with 15 claims. Your client has informed you that they will prepare and forward an English translation of RO-H in due course. This will comprise 29 pages of description and drawings, four pages with 15 claims and an abstract comprising two pages. Your client wants you to file today, 12 December 2022, a European patent application EP-H drafted in Romanian and claiming priority of RO-H.  a. What fees have to be paid and what would be the last date for paying them? b. You filed an automatic debit order for EP-H. On the decisive payment date, you receive an email from the EPO informing you that there are insufficient funds in your deposit account to cover any of the fees to be paid (as identified in your answer to question (a)). You replenish the account two days after receiving the email. Do you have to take any further action to ensure these fees are paid? c. What is the time limit for filing an English translation of the application via the EPO's online services? What is the consequence for the time limit if, on the last day of the period for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services which prevents you from filing it? The outage lasts for the whole of that day. \",\n",
       "   'Answer': '(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)). (c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC. If documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted by the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be received on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the period shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are available (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120).

       "   'Question': '  Applicant A filed European patent application EP-A1 in English in May 2019. It describes two different inventions, X and Y, and claims invention X only. The European search report was drawn up for invention X only. A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting a time limit of four months for response was issued by the EPO on 16 May 2022. A two-month extension of this time limit was granted on 26 September 2022. As of todayâs date, no response has been filed. Applicant A is now interested in invention Y. Today, 12 December 2022, he files a European divisional application EP-A2 based on EP-A1 and describing invention Y. No fees were paid, and no claims were submitted at the time of filing.

In order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request further processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC.

Further processing is only available to applicants (and thus before grant). The non- observance of the time limit to ï¬le comments does not have the direct consequence demanded for re -establishment of rights in Art 122(1).
