Fee amounts need not be mentioned.\n2. What is the time limit for paying these fees?\n3. What happens if these fees are not paid within the time limit, and what can you do\nabout it?",
                "answer": "Question 1\n1. The fees due on filing are the filing fee (including page fees), the search fee and the\ntransmittal fee.\n2. These fees are to be paid within one month of the date of receipt of the international\napplication, i.e. 27 September 2024.\n3.

                "AIAnswer": {
                    "answer": "1. **Fees Due on Filing**: The fees due on filing for WO-X include the filing fee, the search fee, and the transmittal fee.\n\n2. **Time Limit for Payment**: According to the guidelines provided, these fees are to be paid within one month of the date of receipt of the international application, which is 27 September 2024.\n\n3. **Action if Fees Not Paid**: If these fees are not paid within the time limit, the application will be deemed withdrawn. This means that no further actions are required until there are sufficient funds in the deposit account to cover the fees. However, the applicant cannot waive the communication under Rule 112(1) noting the deemed abandonment of claims under Rule 45(3).\n\n**Explanation of References Used**:\n\n- **Reference 1**: The content discusses the fees due on filing and the time limits for payment. It mentions that the fees include the filing fee, search fee, and transmittal fee, and specifies that they must be paid within one month of the date of receipt of the international application. This directly answers the first part of the question about the fees due on filing.\n\n- **Reference 2**: The content explains the withdrawal of the application if fees are not paid within the specified time limit. It states that the application will be deemed withdrawn, meaning no further actions are required until there are sufficient funds in the deposit account. This addresses the second part of the question regarding the consequences of not paying the fees.\n\n- **Reference 3**: The content provides guidance on how to handle the situation where fees are not paid within the time limit. It outlines that the application will be deemed withdrawn, and the applicant cannot waive the communication under Rule 112(1) noting the deemed abandonment of claims under Rule 45(3). This answers the third part of the question about what happens if fees are not paid and what can be done about it.",

Content: 2.3.8 Claims fee The time limit for paying the claims fee referred to inA‑III, 9is 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (Rule 162(1)). The time limit for paying the claims fee referred to inA‑III, 9is 31 months from the date of filing or, if priority has been claimed, from the earliest priority date (Rule 162(1)). If they have not been paid by then, underRule 162(2), they may still be paid within the six-month period underRule 161(1)and(2).Rule 162(2)distinguishes between two situations in which the applicant must ensure payment of claims fees before expiry of the six-month period: Rule 162(2), first sentence, covers the situation in which the applicant does not file amendments after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period underRule 161. In this case, the applicant must ensure that any claims fees not yet paid for the set of claims filed within the 31-month period are paid before expiry of the six-month period underRule 161. Example: A Euro-PCT application X contains 27 claims on expiry of the 31-month period. The applicants pay five claims fees within the 31-month period. They must ensure that seven claims fees are paid before expiry of the six-month period underRule 161. Rule 162(2), second sentence, covers the situation in which the applicants file an amended set of claims after expiry of the 31-month period and before expiry of the six-month period underRule 161. In this case, they must compute the number of claims fees due on the basis of the claims on file on expiry of the six-month period underRule 161 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.8\n\nContent: . The claims fees must be paid within one month of filing the claims. Where correct claims are filed underRule 56a(3)orRule 56a(4)(seeA‑II, 6), the claims fee is calculated on the basis of the set of claims first filed. The claims may be filed at the following stages: (a)on the filing date or on the date on which the divisional application is filed (seeA‑II, 4.1.5andA‑IV, 1.2.1) (b)after the filing date, in a timely response to a communication from the EPO indicating their absence underRule 58(seeA‑III, 15) (c)after the filing date, by applicants on their own initiative before the EPO sends a communication according toRule 58(seeA‑III, 15). Consequently, the claims fees must be paid within one month of whichever of the above dates of receipt applies. If the claims fees have not been paid in due time, they may still be validly paid within a non-extendable grace period of one month from notification of a communication underRule 45(2)pointing out the failure to observe the time limit. The applicant cannot waive this communication. If a claims fee is not paid within the grace period, the corresponding claim is deemed abandoned and the applicant is notified accordingly. The applicant cannot waive the communication underRule 112(1)noting the deemed abandonment of claims underRule 45(3). If the claims fees paid are insufficient to cover all the claims incurring fees (i.e. claim 16 onwards), and if when payment was made no indication was given as to which claims were covered by the fees paid, then the applicant is requested to specify which claims incurring fees are covered by the claims fees paid. The Receiving Section notifies the search division of claims that are deemed abandoned. Any claims fee duly paid is refunded only in the case referred to inRule 37(2)(seeA‑II, 3.2, last paragraph) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9\n\nContent: (a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)).

                    "answer": "### Answer:\n\nTo obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for both Isabel II and Naranjas Navel, they must follow these steps:\n\n1. **File a request for unitary effect**:\n   - File the request for unitary effect with the EPO no later than one month after the mention of the European patent's grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin (Rule 6 of the Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection).\n\n2. **Transfer the application**:\n   - Transfer the application to Naranjas Navel, who has fewer employees and lower turnover compared to Isabel II.\n\n### Minimum Cost Steps:\n\n1. **Filing the request for unitary effect**:\n   - This step does not require additional fees beyond those already incurred for filing the initial application.\n\n2. **Transferring the application**:\n   - The transfer process involves paying the appropriate administrative fee (€0 if requested via MyEPO Portfolio).\n   - Additional fees include:\n     - Reduced sixth renewal fee: €0 (since it’s a transfer)\n     - Reduced fee for grant and printing: €0 (same reason as above)\n\n### Time Limit for Reversing Decision:\n\nIf the request for unitary effect is refused, the time limit for lodging an application to reverse this decision is within three weeks of the refusal (Rule 97.1 RoP UPC). The application should be addressed to the EPO.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Isabel II**: Since Isabel II has transferred its rights to Naranjas Navel, the responsibility for obtaining a unitary patent falls on Naranjas Navel. They must file the request for unitary effect within one month after the mention of the European patent's grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin.\n- **Naranjas Navel**: As the new owner, Naranjas Navel needs to file the request for unitary effect within the same timeframe mentioned above. Additionally, they would need to pay the administrative fee associated with transferring the application.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Wrong:\n\n- **No Action Required in DE, FR, GB**: These countries are not involved in the transfer of rights from Isabel II to Naranjas Navel, so there is no obligation to take further actions in these jurisdictions.\n- **Extension to Poland**: Since Naranjas Navel is the new owner, they are responsible for ensuring the proper filing of the application in Poland, even though the original application was filed by Isabel II.",

                    "answer": "### 1.

In this case, the earliest priority date is 31 December 2024, which corresponds to the filing date of CN1. Therefore, the priority period ends on 2 January 2025. \n\nTo claim priority from CN1, the following steps must be taken:\n\n- **Declaration of Priority**: File a declaration of priority indicating the date of the previous application (CN1), the state or WTO member in which it was filed, and the application number.\n- **Translation Requirement**: Submit a translation of the description into English, since the description was intended to be in English.\n\n### 2. Correction of Description Translation\n\nIf the intention was to translate the description into English, the following actions can be taken:\n\n- **Correction of Application Documents**: Correct the application documents to reflect the actual content of the description in English.\n- **Re-filing**: Re-file the corrected application documents along with the necessary translations.\n\nThe effect on the filing date would depend on when the correction is made. If the correction is made before the deadline for filing the corrected application documents, the filing date remains unchanged. However, if the correction is made after the deadline, the filing date will be updated accordingly.\n\n### 3.

The previous application may have been filed in or for the same or different states or members of the WTO, but in all cases the earliest application must have been filed not more than 12 months before the date of filing of the European application. Subject-matter of a European application will be accorded the priority date of the earliest priority application which discloses it. If, for instance, the European application describes and claims two embodiments (A and B) of an invention, A being disclosed in a French application and B in a German application, both filed within the preceding 12 months, the priority dates of both the French and German applications may be claimed for the appropriate parts of the European application; embodiment A will have the French priority date and embodiment B the German priority date as effective dates. If embodiments A and B are claimed as alternatives in one claim, these alternatives will likewise have the different priority dates as effective dates. If, on the other hand, a European application is based on one previous application disclosing a feature C and a second previous application disclosing a feature D, neither disclosing the combination of C and D, a claim to that combination will be entitled only to the date of filing of the European application itself. In other words, it is not permitted to \"mosaic\" priority documents.

If it is found that the application to which the priority claim is directed is in fact not the first application in this sense, but some or all of the subject-matter was disclosed in a still earlier application filed by the same applicant or a predecessor in title, the priority claim is invalid in so far as the subject-matter was already disclosed in the still earlier application (seeF‑VI, 1.4.1). The filing date of the \"first application\" must be claimed as a priority, i.e. the application disclosing for the first time any or all of the subject-matter of the European application.

To the extent the priority claim is invalid, the effective date of the European application is the date of its filing. The previously disclosed subject-matter of the European application is not novel if the still earlier application referred to above was published prior to the effective date of the European application (Art. 54(2)) or if the still earlier application is also a European application which was published on or after the effective date of the European application in question (Art. 54(3)). Art. 87(1) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4\n\nContent: .3.1). If no priority is claimed from this previously filed application, the filing by reference itself does not generate outstanding rights according toArt. 87(4). For example, in the case of national applications GB1 (filed on 1 February 2002, without claiming priority) and GB2 (filed on 2 January 2008, without claiming priority), pertaining to the same subject-matter, a European application EP1 (filed on 2 January 2009) claims priority of GB2 but refers to GB1 for its content according toRule 40(1)(c). If GB1 is withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without having served as a basis for claiming a right of priority, the mere reference to it underRule 40(1)(c)does not amount to an outstanding right within the meaning ofArt. 87(4). Consequently, in this case the priority claim to GB2 has to be considered valid for EP1. Rule 40(1)(c) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4.1\n\n"

None of the above statements.\n\nExplanation:\n\nBased on the guidelines provided, the applicant needs to follow several steps to enter the EP phase after the filing date. However, none of the options listed cover all necessary actions. Let's break down what the applicant needs to do:\n\n1. **Complete and File Form 1200**: This step involves selecting the appropriate boxes on Form 1200, paying the filing fees, and searching fees. It is mentioned in both the content about missing parts and the correct application documents.\n\n2. **Pay Filing Fees and Search Fees**: These are standard fees required for entering the EP phase.\n\n3. **Select the Box for Early Processing**: This is part of the process outlined in the content about requesting entry into the regional phase.\n\n4. **File Claims**: As per the content, the applicant must file amended claims, which is covered in the content regarding the amendment of claims.\n\n5. **Submit a Translation of Amended Claims**: According to the content, the applicant must file a translation of the amended claims into one of the official languages of the EPO (German, English, or French).\n\n6. **Specify Application Documents**: The applicant must specify the application documents on which the European grant procedure is to be based.\n\n7. **Request Examination**: The applicant must request examination, including payment of the examination fee.\n\n8. **Waive Rights**: The applicant must waive certain rights under Rules 70(2) and 161(2) EPC.\n\nGiven these points, option C (\"Complete and file Form 1200, pay the filing fee and the search fee and appoint a representative\") is incomplete because it omits the requirement to file claims and submit a translation of amended claims. Option B is incorrect because it mentions renewal fees, which were not discussed in the given content. Option A is partially correct but lacks the requirement to file claims and submit a translation of amended claims. Therefore, none of the provided options comprehensively covers all the necessary actions for entry into the EP phase.",

For example: 20.04.2016 (Wed) Priority date 17.10.2016 (Mon) Filing date 31.10.2018 (Wed) Due date for third-year renewal fee underRule 51(1) 20.11.2018 (Tue) Expiry of 31-month period underRule 159(1)= deferred due date for third-year renewal fee 20.05.2019 (Mon) Last day for payment of the renewal fee (plus additional fee) since the six-month period underRule 51(2)expires that day If the applicant requests entry into the regional phase before the expiry of the 31-month period (seeArt. 23(2) PCTandArt. 40(2) PCT), in order for the request to become effective the renewal fee in respect of the third year has to be paid if the fee has fallen due earlier underRule 51(1). If the renewal fee is not paid on the date early processing is requested, the request for early processing will be effective only from the date on which the renewal fee is paid (and all further requirements necessary on the latter date have been complied with) (seeE‑IX, 2.8) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4. Content: 4.2.4 Date of receipt of the debit order; insufficient funds Provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account on the date the EPO receives the debit order or on the execution date, that date will be considered the date on which the payment is made. Provided there are sufficient funds in the deposit account on the date the EPO receives the debit order or on the execution date, that date will be considered the date on which the payment is made. This applies also where a debit order is filed together with an application filed underArt. 75(1)(b)with a competent national authority of a contracting state (seeA‑II, 1.6). If the EPO does not receive the debit order until after expiry of the period allowed for paying feesduewhich can be paidon filing, that period is deemed observed if evidence is available or presented to the EPO to show that the debit order was filed with the competent authority of the contracting state at the same time as the application, provided that sufficient funds were available in the account at the time the period expired. Point 7.2.1 ADAPoint 7.4.1 ADA If, on the date of receipt of the debit order or on the date specified as the execution date (point 10 ADA), the account does not contain sufficient funds to fully cover all the fees indicated for an application (shortfall), the fees are booked in ascending order of application number (\"PCT\" before \"EP\"before \"UP\") and fee code, according to point 7.3 ADA, as long as the funds allow. Once a debit order cannot be executed in full due to insufficient funds, no other debit order is booked until the account is duly replenished. The outstanding payment is considered to have been made on the date on which the deposit account is duly replenished \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4\n\nContent: .1.2). The party is informed of any such correction by means of a communication from the EPO providing a two-month period for objection in the event of disagreement by the party. In that case, the fee will be debited as indicated in the (erroneous) debit order or, if applicable, any corrective booking executed will be reverted. The principles outlined above, however, do not allow the correction of a debit order by adding any fee that is not indicated in it, even if, according to the status of proceedings, that fee is due on the date of receipt of the debit order. Point 10.2 ADA A debit order may be revoked in whole or in part by the person making the payment by sending a signed written notice tosupport@epo.orgby email or by completing the online contact form available on the EPO website (epo.org) and submitting it together with the signed written notice. For a debit order revocation notice to be effective, it must be received by the EPO no later than on the date on which the debit order is received. A debit order with deferred payment date may be revoked in Central Fee Payment until one day before the intended execution date or at the latest on the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to the EPO as indicated above. Point 13 ADA Payments via deposit account effected in Central Fee Payment are validated, meaning that the debit order for a fee is automatically rejected if the fee falls within one of the following categories: –renewal fees and fees for the transfer of rights made in respect of patent applications for which the loss of rights or the refusal has become final –renewal fees for granted European patents –renewal fees received before the earliest valid payment dates underRule 51(1) –double-payments for fees that can be paid only once in the proceedings before the EPO.
