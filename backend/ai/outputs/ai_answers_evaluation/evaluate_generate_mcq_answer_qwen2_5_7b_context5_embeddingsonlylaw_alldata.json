This late-filing of the sequence listing must comply with the applicable WIPO standard. Therefore, if you are invited by the EPO to file a sequence listing, you need to file it and pay a late furnishing fee to the EPO (Option A is correct). Explanation why other options are incorrect: - Option B: While it's true that failure to respond within the two-month period will result in consequences for the application, according to Rule 163(5) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Patent Office, the application is not automatically deemed withdrawn. It may be subject to further proceedings or deadlines. - Option C: The Guidelines do not specify that the sequence listing must be filed in PDF format (Option C). Instead, they state that a sequence listing 'in electronic form drawn up in compliance with the applicable WIPO standard' should be provided. The exact format is left open-ended by the guidelines but typically involves formats accepted by EPO systems. - Option D: Although the amino acid sequence is not part of the claims and only used in an example, it still needs to be disclosed as required by Art. 83 EPC. If it's not available at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, you will need to provide a sequence listing (Option D is incorrect).

After that point, only certain types of errors (bibliographic data, printing errors in publications, and formatting/editing errors) may be corrected.\n\nThe correct answer is D: Date of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. This is because the communication under Rule 71(3), which includes Form 2004 and the Druckexemplar (printed version of the patent specification), is when applicants have their last opportunity to identify errors before the patent is granted.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: One day before the decision to grant a European patent is handed over to the EPO postal service. According to the guidelines, once the decision to grant is handed over to the internal postal service, no further corrections can be made under Rule 139.\n- Option B: Date of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent. By this time, the granting process has concluded, and any errors must have been corrected before or during pending proceedings.\n- Option C: Date of notification of the decision to grant. While important, this date is too late as it comes after the internal postal service has taken over the decision to grant, making corrections under Rule 139 impossible at that point.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_3_1.html"

France would allow direct entry into national phase if it were listed, but it's not.\n\n- **Option C: Italy** - Similarly to Option B, while Italy is also an EPC member and thus allows for direct entry, it’s not specified in the given text as a choice.\n\nHence, with no specific mention of any of these countries being members under the current context provided, the most accurate response is that none of them (D) are listed as options where your client can directly enter the national phase according to this legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html"

Therefore, it is the correct choice.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B: Payment of the filing fee and claims fees** - The text does not indicate that claims fees must be paid to effect early entry into the European phase according to Article 23(2) PCT.\n  \n- **Option C: Payment of the filing fee, the claims fees, the examination fee, the designation fee and the renewal fee for the third year** - Similar to option B, claims fees are not mentioned as a requirement. Additionally, renewal fees are only applicable once the application has entered the national phase, which is not required at this stage.\n\n- **Option D (already chosen) correctly identifies**:\n  - The filing fee\n  - The examination fee\n  - The designation fees for each designated contracting state\n\nThis accurately reflects the requirements for early entry into the European phase according to Article 23(2) PCT as described in the guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the last point in time for an effective withdrawal of a European patent application is 'the date of receipt of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC'. This guideline can be found within the section discussing the conditions and timescales for withdrawing or refusing applications. Specifically, it states that a refund will be provided if the application is withdrawn before substantive examination has begun; this includes situations where an applicant withdraws their application before receiving a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B:** 'The latest of the date of payment of the fee for grant and publishing and the date of filing of the translations of the claims in the two other official languages of the EPO' is not relevant to the point at which a withdrawal can be effective. This option refers to requirements related to the grant process, including paying fees and submitting required documents, but it does not pertain to when an application can still be effectively withdrawn.\n\n- **Option C:** 'Date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin' is incorrect because by this date, the application has already been granted. Once a patent has been published in the Bulletin, it means that the examination process was completed and the patent was issued, making any withdrawal ineffective at this point.\n\n- **Option D:** 'One day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin' is similar to Option C but more specific. Just as with Option C, once a patent application has been published, it cannot be withdrawn effectively because the examination process and potential issues have already been resolved, leading to the issuance of the patent.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided legal text and guidelines, option A correctly identifies the last effective point in time for withdrawing an application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the legal text from decision G 2/98 (OJ 1999, 507), in particular paragraphs 4.6 and 4.7, an error in publishing the European patent specification, such as omitting a page of the description, does not invalidate the grant of the patent. However, this omission can affect the public's ability to understand and assess the extent of protection conferred by the patent. Therefore, corrections can be made even after the opposition period if the correction is necessary for clarity or to ensure that the specification correctly reflects what was granted.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A:** This statement is incorrect because the legal text does not state that such an error cannot ever be corrected; it only needs to be corrected before the publication is final and if necessary after the opposition period.\n  \n- **Option B:** This choice is too absolute, as there are specific circumstances under which corrections can still be made, especially after the opposition period has ended. The legal text allows for corrections even after publication, provided they are needed for clarity or to maintain the patent's validity.\n\n- **Option D:** While it might seem logical that corrections could only be made during pending opposition proceedings, this is not necessarily true based on the legal text from G 2/98. The decision explicitly states that such errors can be corrected after publication as long as they are necessary for clarity and do not invalidate the patent.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html"

Therefore, statement B stating that you may file page 3 of the description at any time up to 2 January 2023 without the application being re-dated is correct. The EPO does not need to invite you to file the missing parts within a certain timeframe; rather, you can do so voluntarily.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A** is incorrect because the guidelines do not mention that the EPO will specifically invite you to file the missing parts within two months.\n- **Option C** is incorrect according to Article 123(3) and Rule 45 of the EPC, which require that any amendments to claims must be supported by the description. Adding new claims at a later stage (after filing but before examination) may not always be permissible if they are not adequately supported in the description.\n- **Option D** is incorrect because withdrawing EP-A and re-filing it would be an unnecessary step, given that you can voluntarily correct the missing parts at any time up to 2 January 2023 without re-dating the application.\n\nThus, B is the most accurate answer based on the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html"

Specifically, under Article 122(3), if the designation fees are not paid within the prescribed period or within a further two months after notification that the deadlines have been missed, an applicant may request re-establishment of rights on the basis of a written communication from the EPO stating that such deadline has been missed.\n\nExplanation for why other options (B, C, D) are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B: Time limit for requesting examination**: According to Rule 70(1), the request for examination cannot be withdrawn. However, if an applicant fails to file a request within the specified period, they can still re-establish their rights by appealing or under Article 122, but this is not specifically mentioned as a remedy that can be requested before the EPO in the provided text.\n\n- **Option C: Time limit for filing the application within the priority period**: The priority period refers to the time between the filing of an earlier application and the filing of the later European patent application. Once a European patent application is filed, missed deadlines concerning this cannot be remedied by re-establishment procedures; instead, one would have to file a new application with the missing priority claim.\n\n- **Option D: Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights**: This option incorrectly suggests that requesting re-establishment itself requires payment. The text does not indicate that an additional fee is required after filing a request under Article 122; typically, the re-establishment procedure involves paying only the necessary fees as part of the application process.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct answer since it aligns with the provisions allowing for re-establishment of rights in cases where designation fees are missed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

The requirement for Hassan to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta would only apply if he were representing her before other patent offices or specific bodies, but not necessarily the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority (ISA). Therefore, B is incorrect.\\n\\n- **Answer A**: This statement can be correct according to Rule 20.1 and its accompanying notes which state that a person appointed as agent may act on behalf of the applicant before international search authorities, including the ISA at the EPO if the ISA is so designated in the record part of the application or by subsequent designation (see PCT Rule 20.1). However, it's not explicitly incorrect based on the information provided.\\n\\n- **Answer C**: According to Rule 64(3) and Rule 59.2 of the PCT, it is indeed mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination be signed by the applicant or a person authorized by the applicant. Hassan being an appointed agent should have the authority to sign such demands on behalf of Greta under power of attorney.\\n\\n- **Answer D**: This statement can also be correct according to Rule 49(1) of the PCT, which states that an international application may only be withdrawn by the applicant or a person authorized to act as an agent. A signed power of attorney would authorize Hassan to act on Greta's behalf for such actions.\\n\\nIn summary, B is not supported by legal text and therefore is incorrect, while A, C, and D are either correct based on PCT provisions or cannot be ruled out as incorrect without further context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

Being employed by a company from one contracting state does not entitle individuals to a reduced fee if they are not residents or nationals of that state.\n  \n- **Option C**: The natural person residing in the USA and being a Belgian national would not be entitled to a filing fee reduction as the USA is not a contracting state, despite being a nationality of the applicant.\n\n- **Option D**: The natural person resident in the USA (not a contracting state) and of Swiss nationality also do not qualify for the fee reduction. Even though Switzerland is a contracting state, the applicant's residence in the USA does not meet the requirement for filing fees.\n\nThus, only option B meets the criteria outlined by Rule 6 EPC as it involves individuals from Germany, which is a contracting state, and hence would be entitled to a reduced fee if they properly declare their status on Form 1001.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html"

The renewal fee for the fourth year can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest.\n\n**Why this choice is correct:**\n\nAccording to Rule 167(3) EPC, the basic renewal fees are payable in each of the states in which protection is claimed. Since you wish to validate the patent in only two contracting states, you need to pay the renewal fee separately for each state where the patent will be validated.\n\nThe due date for the fourth year's renewal fee can be paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest (Rule 167(3) EPC). This means that as long as you pay by this date, it is considered timely and valid.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A**: Suggests a centralized payment to the EPO for the fourth year's renewal fee. According to Rule 167(3), such a payment must be made separately in each state where protection is claimed. Hence, centralizing it would not be correct.\n\n- **Option B**: Proposes the same centralized payment as Option A but with an incorrect due date (30 November 2023). This does not align with Rule 167(3) EPC and is therefore incorrect.\n\n- **Option D**: Again suggests a separate payment for each state, which is correct. However, it states the due date as 16 January 2024 instead of 9 January 2024 at the latest, making this option incorrect based on Rule 167(3) EPC.\n\nTherefore, Option C is the most accurate and compliant with the rules set out in the EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

This includes any part that was amended during the opposition proceedings (see Guidelines D-VI 7.2.2).\n\nOption B is correct because it states that if no appeal is filed, the patent proprietor will be required to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims and type out a formally compliant version of the entire description within four months.\n\nNow let's explain why the other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: This statement suggests that payment would only occur upon request. However, according to the guidelines, it is not based on the party's request; rather, it is a mandatory requirement for maintaining the patent in amended form if no appeal has been filed.\n  \n- Option C: The interlocutory decision should be brief and only note that with the amended text, the opponent no longer maintains their original grounds. It does not include an invitation to make further amendments or file additional documents.\n\n- Option D: This statement incorrectly presumes that the fee is required if no appeal is filed, which goes against the guidelines mentioned in B where it states the requirement only occurs when there is no appeal.\n\nThus, option B accurately reflects the correct procedural steps outlined in the EPO's Guidelines for Examination.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_2.html"

Given that today’s date, as stated in the question, is 12 October 2023, this option does not apply.\\n\\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A**: The application would be deemed withdrawn if no renewal fees had been paid by the due date (9 September 2023), but since it has not yet passed that deadline and there's still a chance to pay the renewal fees, this option is incorrect.\\n\\n- **Option C**: While paying with an additional fee of 50% would allow for payment up until six months after the filing date (i.e., by 12 March 2024), it requires an additional fee that has not been mentioned to be applicable here.

                    "Justification": "This answer is correct because none of the actions listed in A, B, or C are required according to the provided legal text and guidelines for entering an international application into the European phase (EP) at 25 months after the filing date when a request for early processing has been filed. The relevant section E-IX, 2.8, states that on the express request of the applicant, the EPO may process or examine an international application before expiry of the 31-month time limit under Art. 23(2) PCT (Rule 44bis.2 PCT). Since a request for early processing has already been filed, no additional actions related to completing and filing Form 1200, paying fees, or appointing representatives are necessary.\n\nExplanation of why the other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: Completing and filing Form 1200 is not required as the application is entering the EP phase due to an earlier request. Paying a search fee also isn't necessary because it was paid at the CNIPA, which is not relevant for entry into the EP phase.\n- Option B: Paying the renewal fee for the third year (EP fees) isn’t applicable since the application is only in its initial stages of entering the EP phase and no maintenance fees are due yet. \n- Option C: Appointing a representative at this stage is unnecessary as long as the applicant wishes to continue handling the matter themselves or appoints an agent through the EPO's system if necessary. Since a request for early processing has been filed, there’s no requirement to take any of these actions.\n\nTherefore, none of the statements A, B, and C are correct given that only a request for early processing has been made at 25 months after filing.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the guidelines in E-VIII, 2, if a European patent application is withdrawn after payment of the designation fee but before notification of the decision on grant or deemed withdrawal, the applicant may request refund of the designation fee. The date of the decision's notification is later than the date on which the decision is handed over to the EPO internal postal service (i.e., G 12/91 does not apply in this case). Therefore, as long as the application has not been refused and the applicant withdraws it within a certain period before receiving formal notice of grant or deemed withdrawal, they may be eligible for a refund. In this scenario, the earliest point at which the designation fee can potentially be refunded is after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report (option A), but not prior to that.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B**: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not necessarily correlate with the application withdrawal timeline for refunding fees. The guidelines do not specify this as a deadline for withdrawing an application or requesting refunds, and it could be too early in the process to consider withdrawing an application.\n\n- **Option C**: This is the correct answer because according to E-VIII, 2, if the application is withdrawn before receiving formal notice of grant or deemed withdrawal, the applicant may request refund. Therefore, as long as the withdrawal occurs after payment but prior to notification, the designation fee can still be refunded. \n\n- **Option D**: The date of the start of substantive examination (i.e., when the application enters the national phase in a particular country) is not relevant for determining when an applicant may request refunding fees related to grant or publication.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Article 10(4) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO regarding fee payment by bank transfer, a debit order cannot be revoked after it has been executed. The relevant part states that 'A debit order may not be revoked once it has entered the CFP.' In this scenario, the debit order is scheduled to be executed on 18 October 2024, and since the execution date has not yet arrived, it can still potentially be modified or cancelled. \n\n- **Option A (10 October 2024)**: This option is incorrect because the applicant noticed the mistake after filing, which means the debit order has already been entered in CFP and cannot be revoked.\n- **Option B (17 October 2024)**: This is the correct answer as it falls within the period before the scheduled execution date of 18 October 2024. During this time, the applicant can still revoke the order to debit the renewal fee in CFP.\n- **Option C (18 October 2024)**: This option is incorrect because once the debit order has been executed on its scheduled date, it cannot be revoked according to Article 10(4) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n- **Option D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part)**: While this statement could be partially correct depending on the specific circumstances and the EPO's rules, it does not address the timing issue as accurately or comprehensively as option B. Moreover, the Guidelines do allow for revocation before execution.\n\nTherefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP) is 17 October 2024, making answer **B** correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

This provides an opportunity for the applicant to challenge the refusal.\\n\\n**Option C: File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor**\\nThis is also correct according to E-XIII, Rule 120 EPC, which permits an applicant to file a request for re-establishment of rights if they were unable to comply with a time limit due to circumstances beyond their control. This can potentially extend the time limit.\\n\\n**Option B: File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision**\\nWhile this option is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, it aligns with the general practice that decisions will not be given until all formal requirements are met. However, since the applicant has already missed the initial deadline and the Receiving Section has issued a refusal, requesting further processing may not be applicable here unless there is additional information or evidence that can be presented.\\n\\n**Option D: A, B and C are correct**\\nThis is correct because both appealing against the decision and requesting re-establishment of rights are valid actions an applicant can take.

The text from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, explicitly states: 'Following publication of the European patent application under Art. 93, any person may present observations concerning the patentability of the invention. Although lack of novelty and/or inventive step are the most common observations, third-party observations may also be directed to clarity (Art. 84), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), patentability (Art. 52(2)and Art. 52(3), Art. 53 or Art. 57) and unallowable amendments (Art. 76(1), Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3)). Such observations must be filed in writing in English, French or German and must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based.'\n\nExplanation for why the other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: This is incorrect because 'The person that filed third-party observations will not necessarily be a party to the proceedings before the EPO' (Guidelines, E-VI, 3). Also, there is no mention of an obligation for the applicant to respond.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect as it states, 'Third-party observations must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously.' The Guidelines indicate that observations can indeed be filed anonymously. Moreover, there's no requirement mentioned about an official fee being paid (Guidelines, E-VI, 3).\n- **Option C**: While the text does require a statement of grounds to be included, it doesn’t mention an 'official fee' as a necessity for filing third-party observations, making this option inaccurate.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

In this case, since two additional search fees are required, they should be paid by 25 October 2024 (assuming the time limit is one month from the date of communication, which is 25 September 2024). If the applicant does not comply with this requirement, the international patent application could potentially be deemed withdrawn. Thus, option A is correct.\n\n**Explanation why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option B:** According to E-VIII, 2.1.6, it is necessary to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results if you do not agree with the ISA's assessment of unity of invention. This ensures that the applicant can present their arguments and any additional information regarding the inventions in question.\n\n- **Option C:** There are no specific provisions for paying protest fees within the context provided by the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, which deals with refunds of examination fees. Protest fees are not mentioned or related to the situation where an additional search fee is required due to a unity of invention issue.\n\n- **Option D:** While it is true that non-payment of the additional search fees may result in the application being deemed withdrawn, this is only one possible consequence and not explicitly stated as the sole outcome. The Guidelines for Examination do not provide definitive statements on such extreme outcomes without clear evidence or procedural steps (such as non-payment of protest fees) leading to a withdrawal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

Therefore, it would be appropriate for the applicant to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application directly to the EPO.\n\nOption B: This option suggests submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau. The Guidelines do not provide any specific reference or requirement for using a DAS code in this context, so this would be incorrect based on the information provided.\n\nOption C: Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO is not mentioned as a valid procedure according to the guidelines referenced. Electronic submission methods are typically governed by different provisions and may require specific authorizations or conditions that are not covered here.\n\nOption D: Submitting a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application directly to the International Bureau (IB) is not explicitly stated in the provided Guidelines for Examination, and it is generally understood that such documents should be submitted to the EPO itself. Therefore, this option is also incorrect based on the legal text provided.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is correct because Rule 41(5) of the Guidelines allows for submission directly to the EPO through the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

Therefore:\\n- Renewal fees for years 3 to 5 would fall due by 31 October 2024 in respect of EP -X-C0.\\n\\nOption A is incorrect because it states that a renewal fee still has to be paid by 31 October 2024, but it refers to the 5th year instead of the 6th. The divisional application (EP -X-C0) already completed its first full year in 2023.\\n\\nOption C is incorrect because it states that a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 for the 6th year, which would be inaccurate since the 5th year has not yet passed as of this date.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests no renewal fee needs to be paid, but according to the text and context provided, a renewal fee does need to be paid by that date.\\n\\nThus, option B correctly identifies the due date for the renewal fee in respect of the 5th year (i.e., from 16 October 2023 to 16 October 2024) on 31 October 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Article 64(1)(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), for a request for unitary effect, the application must be filed in one of the official languages of the EPO. For Mr Linguist’s case, since the initial application was in Dutch and he wishes immediate registration of the unitary effect, he is required to provide a translation of the specification into an official language that covers all 18 states to which the unitary effect extends. This is because these 18 states have agreed to apply the European Patent Convention and its related provisions.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A**: While Dutch is one of the official languages, Mr Linguist cannot use it for immediate registration under Article 64(1)(2) EPC when seeking a unitary effect that extends across multiple states. The requirement is to provide a translation into an official language accepted by all member states.\n\n- **Option C**: Although Spanish might be an official language of some states, the requirement is specifically for one of the 18 state languages (as per Art. 64(1)(2) EPC), not any of the 24 UPCA signatory states' languages. Thus, this option does not satisfy the immediate registration requirement.\n\n- **Option D**: Spanish, being an official language only in certain countries and not necessarily one of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends, would not meet the necessary condition for immediate registration under Article 64(1)(2) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"

According to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date. Consequently, the 31-month period expires 31 months from the priority date to be restored. A period of one month is permitted for filing a request for restoration of priority at the EPO under Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT and Article 22 PCT. Merely fulfilling the requirements of Rule 159(1) earlier than 31 months from the priority date will not change this, as the EPO can only start processing the application before the 31-month time limit if this is expressly requested by the applicant. If the applicant requests early processing and complies with the requirements of Rule 159(1), the effective date of early entry will change, and the time limit for requesting restoration of the priority period will be one month from the effective date (Euro-PCT Guide, 15th edition, 2022, 5.13.022 – 5.13.023; Guidelines E-IX, 2.8.)"

If the previous application is a Chinese, Korean or United States application, the EPO will include a copy of the previous application free of charge if the European patent application was filed before 1 January 2022 or, in the case of a Euro-PCT application that has entered the European phase before that date, if the required priority document can be included in the file of the application by 30 June 2023 (see the notice from the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A84).

It is also too late to restore the priority under Article 122 EPC, which would have had to happen no later than two months after the 12-month time limit set by Article 87 (1) EPC.\nFP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1.\nFP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2.\nThe disclosure of subject-matter A in FP1 takes away the novelty of claim 1 in EP1.\nSubject-matter A+B was disclosed for the first time in FP2, making FP2 the first filing for this subject-matter. The priority claim is therefore valid for A+B. The effective date for claim 2 is before the publication of FP1, so FP1 cannot be cited as prior art against it."

Article 14(1) RFees mentions provisions related to translation requirements but does not provide additional conditions for the reduction mentioned by Rule 6(3). Explanation as to why Option B is incorrect: While Option B acknowledges that the applicant is entitled to a reduction in the examination fee under Rule 6(3) EPC and Article 14(1) RFees, it incorrectly states that the reduction is not 20%. Since the legal text clearly specifies a 20% reduction, this statement contradicts the accurate information.

This is because according to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the opposition division's invitation with a three-month time limit will expire three months after it was sent. In this case, the invitation was sent on 16 August 2021.\n\nExplanation:\n- Rule 82(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC) states that the parties to the proceedings have three months from the date of service of an invitation or a decision. This period starts running when the party is served with the document, which in this case would be on 16 August 2021.\n- Therefore, the time limit ends on 19 April 2022 (16 August + 3 months).\n\nExplanation for incorrect options:\n- Option B (30 April 2022) is incorrect because it extends the time limit by one week, which does not align with the three-month period stated in Rule 82(2) EPC.\n- The interruptions under Rule 142 EPC and subsequent resumption of proceedings do not affect the calculation of the three-month period for Rule 82(2). According to the Guidelines provided (specifically, 'Moreover, as a rule, decisions will not be given until an internal EPO time limit (e.g. 20 days) following upon the official time limit (but from which the parties may derive no rights) has expired'), such interruptions and resumptions are procedural matters that do not alter the duration of the three-month period for responding to invitations or decisions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-X, 7.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_x_7_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html"

Option A is incorrect because although more than 16 months have passed between the filing dates of EP-1 and US-1, this does not prevent the addition of a priority declaration as long as the European application is filed within 12 months of the first application's filing date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html"

The requirement for clarity applies both to dependent and independent claims.\n\n2. **Why B is correct:**\n   - The opponent's argument that the feature may not be clear if it is phrased as a result to be achieved has some merit because such phrasing might make the claim difficult to understand and enforce.\n   - Clarity of language in patent claims is crucial for enabling a person skilled in the art to understand and implement the invention.\n\n3. **Why C is incorrect:**\n   - Option C states that no lack of clarity would be introduced since the feature was already in the claims set. However, an amendment must not introduce features that are unclear, regardless of their presence in other parts of the application.\n   - The fact that a feature is present in another claim (dependent or independent) does not automatically ensure its clarity when inserted into a different claim.\n\n4. **Why A is incorrect:**\n   - Option A incorrectly asserts an absolute rule stating that features phrased as results to be achieved cannot appear in claims at all, which is not the case according to EPO guidelines.\n   - Features can be phrased as desired outcomes but must still conform to clarity requirements.\n\n5. **Why D does not exist:**\n   - There is no option D provided for consideration here.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html"

(Rule 75 EPC). This is clearly stated in the text: 'So the opponent may still have an interest in the revocation of a lapsed or surrendered patent.'\n\nNow, let's explain why option B is incorrect:\n- Option B incorrectly states that there is no reason to oppose a patent that has been surrendered or has lapsed. As explained above, this statement contradicts Rule 75 EPC and the text provided.\n\nOption C can be considered partly correct but does not fully answer the question in context of opposition proceedings.\n- While it is true that 'The effect of surrender or lapse is ex nunc, while the effect of revocation is ex tunc' (Art. 68 EPC), this option does not address the reason for filing an opposition after a patent has been surrendered or lapsed, which is precisely what the question asks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A as it accurately reflects that opponents may still have interests in revoking patents even if they have been surrendered or lapsed, due to rights and claims that subsist until the date of surrender or lapse.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_5_1.html"

In this case, the patent proprietor has proposed amendments to claims 1, 3, and 4 of its patent to overcome issues related to novelty and inventive step, which are indeed grounds for opposition under Art. 100 EPC (European Patent Convention). The additional amendment to claim 2 is motivated by clarity concerns, which do not directly relate to the grounds for opposition stated in Art. 100.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that the guidelines explicitly state that 'Opposition proceedings cannot be used merely to tidy up and improve the disclosure in the patent specification.' This implies that while improvements can be made, they must still be tied to overcoming a ground for opposition. The clarification of claim 2 is likely considered an improvement rather than a genuine attempt to address a specific ground for opposition.\\n\\nSince clarity issues are not grounds for opposition under Art. 100 EPC, amending the patent solely on this basis would not be permitted in the context of opposition proceedings. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the proprietor should not include claim 2 unless it is linked directly with one of the specified grounds for opposition.\\n\\nAnswer B (No) is correct because while the clarification of claim 2 may be permissible outside of opposition proceedings, it cannot be justified solely as a response to a ground for opposition and therefore would be inadmissible in this context.

However, there is no legal text provided within the context discussing any provision or rule that would extend a fee reduction to cover such additional costs. The guidelines focus on the core principles of non-deferred payment and lack of discretion in waiving fees (A-X,8) as well as other procedural matters. These do not suggest or imply an expansion of fee reductions beyond those explicitly stated.\n\nSince there is no specific mention of including extra page charges within the provided text, it's reasonable to conclude that such additional costs are not covered by the general framework for fee reduction under Rule 6(3) EPC. Thus, the correct answer is 'No' (Option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 11.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_11_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_8.html"

According to Article 123(2) EPC, amendments must be such that they do not extend the subject matter or protection covered by the application as filed. In this case, restricting the filler list from graphite, talc, asbestos, or silica to just graphite, talc, or silica does not introduce any new technical features and merely narrows the scope of protection.\n\nExplanation for why Answer B is incorrect: If we were to choose 'No,' it would imply that the amendment introducing an element outside the initially disclosed fillers (graphite, talc, asbestos, or silica) into claim 1 would be permissible. This is not the case because Article 123(2) EPC restricts any amendments from expanding the scope of protection beyond what was originally disclosed.\n\nThe other answer options C and D are not provided in this question, but generally speaking:\n- There are no additional options (C or D), as only two choices (A and B) were given.\n- Both 'Yes' and 'No' have been explained above.

A withdrawal must have the authority or consent from all joint applicants for it to be effective (E-IX, 2.1.1).

The applicant must also demonstrate that the date was missed unintentionally.\n- **Answer D:** Although this option correctly identifies that the applicant needs to show they were unable, despite taking all due care, to meet the time limit for claiming priority, it is not as precise as Answer C because it does not explicitly include the element of proving unintentionality which is crucial according to Rule 37(1) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

According to the provisions of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), international applications must enter a regional phase within 30 months from the priority date or the filing date, whichever is later. In this case, the application PCT-1 was filed on March 14, 2022, which is 31 months after the priority date of March 14, 2021. Since the 31-month period has elapsed, it would not be possible to enter the EPO regional phase for this international application.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\nB: Yes, provided the priority of US-1 is withdrawn.\nThis option is incorrect because withdrawing the priority claim (US-1) does not affect the expiration of the 31-month period. The period to enter the regional phase is calculated from the filing or priority date of the international application itself, and it cannot be extended by withdrawing a priority claim.\n\nC: Yes, provided use is made of the provisions for further processing.\nThis option is incorrect because there are no specific provisions in the EPO Guidelines that allow for entering into the regional phase beyond the 31-month period. The entry into the European phase must occur within this timeframe as per PCT regulations and the rules governing international applications, without any extensions being available.\n\nD: Not applicable (not listed as an option).\nThis is not a valid answer since D does not correspond to one of the given options for answering the question.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html"

Since there was no claim to a priority date, the relevant date for determining the renewal fee payment period is 16 June 2019 (the filing date). Therefore, the renewal fee in respect of the third year should be paid by the end of that month, which is 30 June 2022. Answer A states '30 June 2021,' but this appears to have been a mistake. The correct answer based on the guidelines would be 30 June 2022 (noting the year in the question). However, for the purposes of answering within the context provided by the given options and assuming a misprint, we select 'A' as it is the closest option.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B: 26 December 2021** - This date does not correspond to any specific month associated with the filing or priority date of the application. The renewal fee for the third year should be paid by a date in June, not December.\n  \n- **Option C: 2 January 2022** - While this is within the calendar year of the third anniversary (16 June 2022), it's too late to avoid paying the surcharge. The guidelines indicate that fees must be paid by the end of the relevant month, which in this case would be 30 June 2022.\n  \n- **Option D: 17 January 2022** - This date is even later than Option C and would result in payment being overdue, thus likely attracting a surcharge.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer should be 'A' (assuming it means to indicate the end of June), but strictly speaking, based on the correct timeline, the renewal fee for the third year should be paid by 30 June 2022.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3_9.html"

This is stated under the section on 'Supplementary European searches,' which indicates that where an international (PCT) application enters the European regional phase and has not been searched with unity, the applicant can pay an additional fee to request a full search for the invention of claim 10. Option B is correct because it aligns with the provision mentioned in the Guidelines. The text states: 'Where an international (PCT) application is found to lack unity of invention, no reasoned statement on this finding is included in the search report and no invitation to pay further search fees is issued. However, it may be possible for applicants to pay these fees directly to the national offices.' Option A is incorrect because filing a divisional application after entry into the European phase would not automatically result in a supplementary search being performed. Divisional applications are separate proceedings that do not necessarily lead to an automatic search. Option C is incorrect as well; there is no specific reference in the provided texts to paying additional fees 'within two months of notification by the EPO.'

The guidelines indicate that oral proceedings should be held if a party so requests, unless there are exceptional circumstances (T 1606/07, T 1976/08), which does not specifically apply to the Receiving Section.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because opposition divisions may only refuse such requests after clarification. The guidelines state that oral proceedings must be held if a party so requests, unless there are specific circumstances allowing for refusal, and these do not apply to opposition divisions (T 1829/10, T 2373/11).\n\n- Option D is incorrect as the Legal Division does not have discretion over whether or not to hold oral proceedings.

This is because Rule 159(1) EPC states that an 'appointed person' shall be appointed to act on behalf of the applicant in proceedings before the European Patent Office (EPO). However, if the applicants are based in Japan and there is no specific requirement for a professional representative or legal representative under Article 123(3) PCT as amended by Agreement 25, they can fulfill their obligations themselves.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: This option suggests that 'a professional representative must be appointed,' which is not necessarily true. The EPC does not require a professional representative to handle the application unless explicitly mandated for the specific jurisdiction or if there's a risk of compromising the application, such as language issues or specific legal requirements.\n\n- Option C: While this answer states 'Yes, the applicants can themselves comply with the requirements of Rule 159(1) EPC,' it overlooks that in some cases, an appointed person is required. However, without additional context suggesting otherwise (such as language barriers or other jurisdiction-specific requirements), this option remains correct for typical scenarios.\n\nThus, based on the given information and the fact that Rule 159(1) EPC does not impose a mandatory requirement for professional representation in all cases, particularly where applicants are from countries like Japan which do not have specific restrictions under Article 123(3) PCT as amended by Agreement 25, Option B (which is implied to be the same as C but incorrectly stated) and A cannot be definitively chosen without more context.

In this case, subject-matter A (claim 1) is identical between FP2 and potential FP1, and no relevant prior art has been found regarding it or claim 2 (A+B). Additionally, since FP1 is still pending, both claims can potentially be validly included in EP1.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there are no grounds to believe that the priority claim from FP1 cannot be used. The guidelines do not indicate any circumstances under which a subsequent application could not use the priority of an earlier application if the matter claimed in the later application was already present in the prior filing. In this scenario, we have no reason to conclude that the priority claim from FP1 is invalid.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because there are no reasons provided to suggest that subject-matter A (claim 1) will not be granted based on the priority claim from FP1 becoming prior art for subject-matter A. The guidelines do not mention any situation where a pending application's content can invalidate another application’s ability to claim its priority.\n\nThe correct course of action, as per the information given and without any contrary evidence or prior art, would be to file EP1 with both claims 1 and 2 if possible, while ensuring that the priorities are claimed correctly.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_3.html"
