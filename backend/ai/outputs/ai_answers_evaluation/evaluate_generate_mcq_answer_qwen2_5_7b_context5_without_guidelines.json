The correct actions required are as follows:\n\n- Completing and filing Form 1200: This form is necessary for entering into the European phase (C-V, 16 - March 2022 version).\n- Paying the filing fee: This is a mandatory payment when entering the European phase.\n- Paying the search fee: Since the search report has already been issued by CNIPA and it's part of the international application's documents, no additional search fee needs to be paid.\n\nOption B includes an incorrect action (paying the renewal fee for the third year), which is not necessary in this context. Option C adds appointing a representative, which is not mandatory unless specifically required due to the applicant’s circumstances or the nature of the case (C-V, 31 - March 2022 version).

According to EPC Rule 70 (Rule 2), if an applicant wishes to withdraw their request for examination, they must do so within the period specified by the European Patent Office after receiving the invitation to proceed further with the application or after the search report has been published. Since the designation fee was validly paid and no provision for refund is mentioned in the text related to this scenario, option C is correct.\n\n- Option A: Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report (EPC Rule 70) refers to the period within which a request for examination must be filed. It does not pertain to withdrawing an application or seeking a refund.\n- Option B: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report is not relevant in this context, as it relates to when substantive examination can start and not the withdrawal of an application or fee refund process.\n- Option D: Date of the start of substantive examination (Rule 71(3) EPC) is irrelevant here. It concerns a different stage in the patent procedure where examination of the application begins after the payment of additional fees, which does not relate to withdrawing the application or seeking refunds for already paid designation fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 55, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r55.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html"

In this case, the renewal fee was to be debited from 18 October 2024, and the applicant noticed on 10 October 2024 that the fee should not be included in the order. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee is 17 October 2024, as per Rule 50(4) of RPEPO.\n\nOption A (10 October 2024): This choice is incorrect because Rule 50(4) allows for the revocation to be made at any time up until midnight on the day before execution, which would be 17 October 2024. Revoking it after that date means the fee will be automatically debited.\n\nOption C (18 October 2024): This is incorrect because Rule 50(4) strictly specifies that a debit order can only be revoked up until midnight of the day before its execution, which in this case would be 17 October 2024. Revoking it on or after 18 October 2024 would not prevent the fee from being debited.\n\nOption D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part): This option is incorrect because Rule 50(4) explicitly states that a debit order can be revoked in part at any time up until the specified deadline, provided the fee has not yet been charged. Therefore, it is possible to revoke an order before its execution date.\n\nThus, the correct answer is B: 17 October 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC RFees 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f7.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, E.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_e_9_1.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, E.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_e_4_5.html"

The correct remedy for such a situation would be to file an appeal against the decision to refuse the application.\n\nThe EPC does not provide a specific procedure for re-establishing rights due to missed time limits related to the designation of inventor (as opposed to other circumstances like losing priority or failing to pay fees on time). Thus, option C regarding 'request for re-establishment of rights' is incorrect. Moreover, while it might be possible that further processing could be requested under some EPC rules, Rule 60(1) does not provide a mechanism specifically for this scenario.\n\n**Explanation why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option B (File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision):**\n  The option is not correct based on the provided legal text. There is no specific provision in Rule 60 EPC or Article 98(2) EPC that allows an applicant to request further processing in this context.\n\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor):**\n  While it is true that applicants can sometimes file requests for re-establishment of rights due to various reasons, there is no explicit provision in Rule 60 EPC or Article 123(4) EPC (which deals with re-establishing rights) specifically allowing this remedy for missed time limits related to the designation of inventor.

Option B is correct as stated in the provided text: 'The provisions concerning the filing of third-party observations (Art. 115 EPC), which must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously, apply.' Option C is incorrect because the requirement to include a statement of grounds on which they are based and an official fee is not mentioned in Art. 115 EPC.

The applicant is required to pay these additional search fees within two months from the date on which the communication was sent. In this case, you received a communication dated 25 September 2024, so you need to pay the two additional search fees by 25 October 2024.\n\n**Explanation for Option B:**  \nThis option is incorrect because Rule 64(1) EPC and Case Law IV do not provide any provision that allows an applicant to avoid filing a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results.

In this scenario, the international patent application claims the priority of a Luxembourg patent application, but no certified copy was filed at the time of the international application's filing.\\n\\n**Option A: Request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO**\\nThis option is correct because Rule 53(2) states that if the previous application is not in an official language of the European Patent Office, or if the validity of the priority claim is relevant to determining the patentability of the invention, the EPO can invite the applicant to file a translation. Here, since no certified copy was filed at the time, it would be necessary to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy.\\n\\n**Option B: Submit a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau to enable it to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application**\\nThis option is incorrect because the EPO does not use the International Bureau for obtaining priority documents. The priority document should be obtained directly from the authority with which the previous application was filed, in this case, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\\n\\n**Option C: File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO**\\nThis option is incorrect because Rule 53(2) specifies that a copy of the previous application must be certified as correct by the authority with which it was filed. Simply filing an electronic copy without certification would not fulfill the requirement.\\n\\n**Option D: File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau**\\nThis option is incorrect for the same reason mentioned in Option B; the EPO does not use the International Bureau to obtain priority documents directly.

In this scenario, if the opposition division decided to revoke the patent (EP) at the end of the opposition proceedings based on Firm B's arguments that the subject-matter was not new in view of document D1, then Firm B would be entitled to file an appeal against the decision as per Art. 108 EPC and Rule 103(2) EPC.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nB: This option is incorrect because it redundantly states that Firm B is entitled to file an appeal regardless of whether the opposition division decided to maintain or revoke the patent. The correct statement should specify only one outcome (revoke/maintain).\n\nC: While Firm C did provide observations, according to the rules and case law provided, the right to appeal lies with the party who filed the opposition, which is Firm B in this case. Therefore, Firm C would not have standing to file an appeal based on their role as a third party observer.\n\nD: If Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings, it would no longer be entitled to file an appeal against any decision by the opposition division regarding the maintenance or revocation of the patent (T 2165/08 and T 702/15). The withdrawal of the opposition means that Firm B has abandoned their position before the opposition division could make a final decision, thus eliminating their right to appeal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Article 14(4) EPC, natural or legal persons having their residence or principal place of business within the territory of a contracting state with an official language other than English, French, or German may file documents in that official language and must then provide a translation into one of the official languages of the EPO (in this case, English) within the specified time limit. Since Korhonen is a Finnish national resident in Finland, he can submit his amended claims in Finnish and must thereafter translate them into English as it is an official language of the EPO. The other options are incorrect because they either misinterpret or contradict the provisions stated in Article 14(4) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the rules for PCT Direct as outlined in the provided legal text, option B is not correct because it involves filing an international application in a language different from that used in the priority application. Specifically, the text indicates that 'PCT Direct may be requested by the applicant if the priority application and the subsequent international application are filed in the same language (e.g., both in English or both in French) using ePCT-Filing or Online Filing 2.0.' This directly rules out option B since it mentions filing an international application in English, whereas the search opinion was raised on a priority application that is not explicitly stated to be in any of these languages.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: While this scenario might seem plausible due to the use of ePCT-Filing and the language being French (one of the official languages), it does not meet the criteria for PCT Direct because the priority application is a Belgian application. According to the text, PCT Direct is only available if both applications are filed in one of the EPO's official languages.\n\n- Option C: This scenario fits the eligibility requirements for PCT Direct as described in the provided legal text. Both the priority and subsequent international applications are filed in English, which is an official language of the EPO, thus meeting the necessary criteria.\n\n- Option D: Amended claims being required with a PCT Direct letter does not disqualify it from being eligible; rather, this could be seen as a procedural requirement that might apply regardless. The primary issue lies in the language compatibility and method of filing which are the central points for eligibility to use PCT Direct.\n\nTherefore, option B is incorrect based on the provided legal text's requirements for PCT Direct's application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_2.html\nSource: PCT Rule 20, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r20.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: Case Law II, D.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_d_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the provisions outlined in the EPC and specifically as per J12/09 (OJ 2014, 683), for applications filed under the Unitary Patent system, a translation into an official language of any state that has implemented the UPCA must be provided when requesting unitary effect. This means that if Mr Linguist wants immediate registration of the unitary effect, he should ensure the translation is in one of these languages.\\n\\n- **Option A** states Dutch. While the application was filed in Dutch, not all European countries have Dutch as an official language. Thus, this option does not necessarily meet the requirement for a language that has implemented the UPCA.\\n\\n- **Option C** mentions 24 states, which is incorrect because only 18 states are currently signatories to the Unitary Patent Package and have fully implemented it.\\n\\n- **Option D** suggests providing a translation into Spanish. While Spain is one of the member states under the UPCA, Spanish is not an official language that must be used for translations according to the relevant EPC provisions mentioned.\\n\\nTherefore, Option B is correct as it aligns with the legal requirements for immediate registration of unitary effect under the Unitary Patent system.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r4.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_1.html"
