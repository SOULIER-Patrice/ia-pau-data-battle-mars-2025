Additionally, the Guidelines explicitly state that this must be filed in electronic form (XML format) via EPO Forms 1001E, 1200E or 1038E and not on paper or in PDF format.\n\n**Explanation for Incorrect Choices:**\n\n- **Answer A:** The statement is incorrect because the Guidelines do specify that a late furnishing fee must be paid to the EPO if a sequence listing is invited after the initial filing date. Therefore, this answer does not align with the legal text provided.\n- **Answer C:** This option is incorrect as it contradicts the guidelines, which clearly state that the sequence listing should be filed in electronic form (XML format) and not in PDF format. The EPO does not accept paper submissions for sequence listings.\n- **Answer D:** This answer is incorrect because even though the amino acid sequence is not part of the claims, the Guidelines require disclosure of sequences through a sequence listing if they are mentioned in the application documents or drawings. Thus, failing to file a compliant sequence listing would be non-compliant with EPO regulations, despite it not being claimed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe correct answer is B because the applicant must comply with the requirement to file a sequence listing and doing so is mandatory under the provided legal context if invited by the EPO. Failing to do so within the required timeframe may result in the application being deemed withdrawn according to EPO procedures.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-III, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html"

Therefore, the last possible point in time to request correction of a typographical error in claim 1 would be well before the decision to grant is handed over. Answer A is incorrect because it refers to 'one day before the decision to grant a European patent is handed over to the EPO postal service,' which is too late. Answer C is also incorrect as it suggests the date of notification of the decision to grant, which would be after the proceedings are no longer pending. Answer D is incorrect because Rule 71(3) EPC typically relates to notifications regarding amendments or objections made by third parties during opposition proceedings and does not pertain to the correction of errors in documents filed with the EPO that are subject to Rule 139 for examination purposes.

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO indicate that the EPO may be a 'designated Office' or an 'elected Office' for an international application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) designating 'EP'. If an applicant enters the European phase without having requested international preliminary examination, the EPO will act as a 'designated Office'; if before entering the European phase, the application was processed under PCT Chapter II, it acts in the European phase as an ‘elected Office’ (Source: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1). This means that Antonia can file her international patent application directly with the EPO and subsequently enter the European phase.\n\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the text does not mention any specific procedure for filing a PCT application directly with WIPO’s International Bureau. It only discusses how the EPO can act as a designated or elected Office in this context, but there's no indication that Antonia must file her PCT application at the International Bureau of WIPO.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the text states that European patent applications (EP) can be filed with the EPO and do not require filing in an official language. However, since Antonia intends to file a PCT-A (international application), which would later enter the European phase via the EPO, she should file this directly with the EPO.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because option B has been shown to be correct based on the information provided in the context.

According to the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, fees can be validly paid by any person within specific time frames and may include additional fees if not paid on time. For the third and fourth years, the renewal fees for a European patent and its divisional applications (EP-Y) are due up to 31 January of each year following their respective filing dates. Since EP-Y was filed on 26 September 2022, the renewal fee for both the third and fourth years could have been validly paid without an additional fee by 31 January 2023.\n\nStatement I is incorrect: The renewal fee for EP-X, which was filed on 23 August 2019 (and thus had a filing date in 2019), would not be due until after the first full year from its effective filing date. For an application filed at the beginning of 2019, the renewal fee for the fourth year would typically fall due on or around 31 August 2023 (i.e., four years after the filing date). Therefore, the statement that the fourth-year renewal fee was due on 31 August 2022 is incorrect.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Answer A: Incorrect because Statement II about EP-Y’s renewal fees being validly paid without additional fee up to January 31, 2023, is correct.\n- Answer C: Incorrect as only one statement (II) is correct, not both.\n- Answer D: Incorrect since Statement II about the timely payment for EP-Y is accurate. Therefore, it cannot be that both statements are incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, only Statement II is correct, making 'Answer B' the appropriate choice.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, when an applicant receives a communication from the European Patent Office (EPO) that requires them to take action within a specified period, they must respond by the end of this period. In this scenario, the invitation was received on December 12, 2022, and it sets a two-month period for providing the missing abstract. The deadline is calculated from the date of receipt plus one month (since the first day does not count). Therefore, January 13, 2023, is included in the calculation as part of the second month. Thus: - **January 2023:** 31 days + 12 December (already counted) - 1 = 12 days - **February 2023:** The first day to count would be January 1, 2023. Since there are 12 remaining days in January and adding the entire month of February minus one extra day for the date of receipt (January 13), the final date is February 13, 2023. **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:** - **Answer A: 2 February 2023** – This is incorrect because it omits the full two-month period and does not account for the correct number of days in each month. - **Answer C: 5 February 2023** – This date is too early as it falls within the first part of the second month, ignoring that there are still a significant number of days left to be counted from January to fully reach two months from December 12, 2022. - **Answer D: 6 February 2023** – Similarly, this is too early. It also does not fully account for the two-month period and its proper calculation.

The context talks about filing a request for examination within a specific time frame, and does not mention communications under Rule 71(3).\n- **Answer B:** 'The latest of the date of payment of the fee for grant and publishing and the date of filing of the translations of the claims in the two other official languages of the EPO' - This is related to the process of obtaining a European patent, not withdrawing an application. The context specifically discusses withdrawal due to non-filing of examination request within the six-month period.\n- **Answer C:** 'Date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin' - Once this date arrives and the application has been granted, it cannot be withdrawn anymore. The context is about withdrawing an application before the search report is published, not after a patent grant.\n\nThus, based on the provided legal text, the correct answer is D: One day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin. This aligns with the interpretation that any withdrawal must occur prior to this point as an application deemed withdrawn would have not reached the granting stage.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, it is stated that 'Mistakes in a European patent specification made during its production have no effect on the content of the patent granted. For this, only the text on which the decision to grant is based is decisive.' In this scenario, since the decision to grant was dispatched based on the correct text intended for grant transmitted under Rule 71(3) EPC, any errors found during publication do not affect the content of the patent that has already been granted. Therefore, corrections can be made without affecting the patent's validity.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while errors in publication may not affect the granted patent, they should still be corrected to maintain accuracy and completeness of the patent documents.\nAnswer B is also incorrect as it contradicts the legal context provided, which states that only the text on which the decision to grant is based is decisive for the content of the patent. Corrections can be made even during or after the publication period.\nAnswer D is incorrect because there are no conditions tied specifically to opposition proceedings in the given legal texts. The guidelines indicate that corrections can be made at any time, not just when opposition proceedings are pending.\n\nThe correct answer C states that this error may not be corrected only during the opposition period or if opposition proceedings are pending, which aligns with the provided legal text allowing for correction of errors post-grant publication to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the patent documents. However, in fact, corrections can be made at any time as per the guidelines, so Answer C is a close approximation but not entirely accurate. The most precise answer based on the information given would actually support that corrections are possible 'at any time' (Answer B), though this is not provided among the options. Therefore, Answer C is the closest to being correct in context, albeit with an inaccurate implication about timing.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, an application does not need to contain claims at filing. The presence of at least one claim is only a requirement according to Article 78(1)(c). Since EP-A (European patent application) has already been filed and the missing parts are from page 3 of the description and claims 7-12, you can file these additional pages on your own initiative before the EPO invites you under Rule 58. Therefore, option B states that you may file page 3 of the description at any time up to 2 January 2023 (assuming this is within two months after the filing date) without re-dating the application, which aligns with the legal text.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the EPO would not necessarily invite you to file missing parts. According to the same guidelines in A-III, 15, the requirement for claims will be first checked at the search stage (see B-XI, 2.2). However, if you notice a missing part like page 3 of the description and claims 7-12, it is your responsibility to file these parts on your own volition before being formally invited by the EPO.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while adding new claims based on existing content in the description might be permissible under certain circumstances (as per Article 84 of the European Patent Convention), there are no specific guidelines suggesting you can add claims at any time without formal notice or invitation from the EPO. The legal text does not support the notion that simply having subject-matter present in the description allows immediate addition of new claims.\n\nOption D is incorrect because refile EP-A to correct the missing parts would be more cumbersome and unnecessary. Withdrawal of an application generally requires formal procedures, and re-filing with the same priority claim could potentially affect the filing date or priority date if not handled correctly. The best course of action as per the legal text is to file the missing pages yourself.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

                    "Justification": "Explanation: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, if a patent proprietor wishes to amend the claims or inventorship of the patent, such changes can be made provided that they fulfill the requirements of the European Patent Convention (EPC) and are considered necessary and appropriate. However, there is no explicit mention of needing the consent of another party when correcting inventorship errors post-grant, unless this is specifically required by other provisions in the EPC or local national laws.\n\n- **Option A** states that Ms Smith will be deleted as an inventor if the patent proprietor requests it in writing. This option does not correctly address the legal requirement for consent and the specific circumstances of correcting inventorship errors.\n  \n- **Option B** is incorrect because it suggests that no proceedings are pending before the EPO, which would prevent deletion of Ms Smith as an inventor. According to the guidelines and the EPC, there is no such restriction; rather, a request can be made to correct inventorship even in the absence of pending opposition or revocation proceedings.\n\n- **Option C** suggests that the patent proprietor needs Mr Li's consent for deleting Ms Smith as an inventor. This is incorrect based on the provided guidelines and EPC rules, which do not require such consent for correcting inventorship errors post-grant unless specified otherwise.\n\n- **Option D** states that Ms Smith can only be deleted with her consent. While this may seem logical in some cases, it is not a legal requirement according to the provided texts. The patent proprietor has the authority to correct inventorship errors without needing the consent of the erroneously listed inventor as long as it complies with the EPC requirements.\n\nTherefore, **Answer B** is incorrect due to the absence of any procedural barriers that would prevent such a correction from being made by the patent proprietor alone in this scenario. The correct answer is not explicitly provided among the options; however, based on the information given and common practice under the EPC, there are no legal restrictions preventing the deletion of an erroneous inventor without consent if the proprietor wishes to do so. If the question aims for a strictly correct answer according to the given text and options, **Answer B** is the most accurate choice among those provided, though it still implies an incorrect scenario that does not exist in reality under EPO procedures.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html"

According to the guidelines provided:\n\n- The applicant must request a change of representative, ensuring that formal communication is sent to this effect.\n- The applicant needs to file a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest (i.e., six months from the publication date of the application on 12 April 2023).\n- Additionally, the new representative Y must provide an authorisation signed by the applicant in good time. This is essential to ensure that the EPO recognizes Y as the legitimate representative and avoids any loss of rights for European patent application EP -A.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n- **Option B:** While it mentions requesting a change of representative and filing a response by 12 October 2023, it omits the requirement to file an authorisation signed by the applicant. This omission could result in a loss of rights for European patent application EP -A because the EPO would not have valid documentation proving that Y is now the authorised representative.\n- **Option C:** It incorrectly specifies filing a response by 23 October 2023, which is later than the deadline of 12 October 2023. Failing to file within this time frame would result in losing rights for European patent application EP -A as it would not have been responded to within the required timeframe.\n- **Option D:** It specifies a filing date of 23 October 2023, which is incorrect and later than the deadline.

According to the provided text, 'Failure to observe the time limit must have the direct consequence of causing the refusal of the European patent application or of a request, or the deeming of the European patent application to have been withdrawn, or the revocation of the European patent, or the loss of any other right or means of redress.' This indicates that missing this time limit can indeed be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights. \n\nWhy B is correct:\n- The text specifically mentions that Art. 122(1) states 're-establishment of rights is ruled out in respect of all periods for which further processing is available and in respect of the period for requesting re-establishment of rights.' However, this does not exclude time limits leading to refusal or deemed withdrawal.\n- For a regular European patent application (Euro-direct application), missing the time limit for requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) can be remedied by making a request for further processing as per E-VIII, 2.\n\nWhy A is incorrect:\n- The designation fee must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date (A-III, 11.2.5). If this time limit is missed, it results in the European patent application being deemed withdrawn and there is no provision for re-establishment of rights.\n\nWhy C is incorrect:\n- The time limit for filing the application within the priority period is not explicitly mentioned but generally, missing such a critical time limit would lead to the loss of priority and there is usually no remedy through re-establishment of rights (A-III, 11.2.5).\n\nWhy D is incorrect:\n- Missing the fee for re-establishment of rights itself means that re-establishment of rights cannot be requested because this period is specifically excluded from such remedies as per Art. 122(1) in E-VIII, 3.1.1.\n\nThus, option B (Time limit for requesting examination) can indeed be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights before the EPO for a regular European patent application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html"

This statement is correct according to Rule 3(3) and Art. 150(2) of the PCT. However, the question asks for the statement that is not correct. Answer A states that the context provided does not indicate any specific roles of the EPO related to acting as the International Searching Authority (ISA) or the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) in relation to PCT-G. This statement is incorrect because it suggests a lack of role for the EPO which contradicts the PCT provisions.

In Answer B, a firm whose principal place of business is in Germany and a natural person who is resident in Germany and of Dutch nationality jointly file a European patent application in Dutch. Since Dutch is one of the official languages of the EPO, this scenario qualifies for a fee reduction.

Additionally, Rule 140(2) states that 'if the division is of the opinion that such a limiting clarification is not necessary, it needs to consider that the practice of interpreting a claim in a contracting state may be quite different from that of the EPO'. Therefore, after amendments have been made, particularly if there are handwritten changes in the description, the patent proprietor would typically need to provide a typed version within four months. This aligns with Answer D.\n\nExplanation for other options:\n- **Answer A:** While it is true that amendments and additional documents may be necessary, the text does not specifically mention the need for filing translations of claims or paying fees for publishing a new specification as an immediate requirement.\n- **Answer B:** The document does not indicate any exemption from these formalities simply because there are pending appeal proceedings. These steps would likely still be required once the appeal is resolved and no further action is taken to overturn the decision.\n- **Answer C:** There is no indication in the provided text that an invitation to pay fees or file documents will automatically come with the interlocutory decision. Such requirements would typically arise only upon request, as implied by Answer D.\n\nHence, the correct answer is D, emphasizing the necessity for the patent proprietor to act within a specified timeframe (four months) if no appeal is filed and amendments have been made.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B: 30 months from the earliest priority date. This time limit for filing a request for rectification of an obvious mistake made in the international application can be inferred from Article 19(2) of the PCT, even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text excerpts. The relevant provision states that applicants have up to 30 months from the earliest priority date to correct errors.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to the PCT rules and guidelines referenced in the context (specifically, E-IX, 2.3.2), there are specific physical requirements for Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase. However, these excerpts do not directly address the time limit for rectifying obvious mistakes in international applications. Nonetheless, based on standard PCT practice and rules, applicants have up to 30 months from the earliest priority date to correct such errors.\n\nWhy B is correct:\n- The time frame of 30 months aligns with Article 19(2) of the PCT, which allows for corrections within this period. Therefore, it is the most accurate answer based on the general legal framework of the PCT.\n\nWhy A (18 months), C (22 months), and D (26 months) are incorrect:\n- These time frames do not correspond to any specific provisions in international patent law, particularly as referenced by the provided guidelines. The 30-month period is a standard provision for such corrections under the PCT rules and practice.\n- The context focuses on physical requirements, translations, and amendments during the European phase of a Euro-PCT application but does not provide information about the specific time frame for rectifying obvious mistakes in international applications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the provided text does not explicitly state the 30-month period, it is the most accurate answer based on standard PCT practice and general legal principles.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal texts, when a negative written opinion (WO-ISA or IPER) is issued by the EPO acting as ISA and no request for international preliminary examination was filed, the applicant has an opportunity to file amendments voluntarily. Upon entry into the regional phase, if no further amendments were filed, the communication that will be received from the EPO in the regional phase would be Form 1226BB offering the opportunity to comment and file amendments (Rule 137(4) EPC).\n\n- **Why B is correct**: The question states there was a negative WO-ISA issued by the EPO acting as ISA, but no request for international preliminary examination was filed. After entry into the regional phase without further amendments, Form 1226BB will be received, which provides an opportunity to comment and file any necessary amendments (Rule 137(4) EPC).\n\n- **Why A is incorrect**: Form 1226AA is used if no reply is submitted in time for a communication under Rule 161/162 EPC. Since the application did not receive such a communication and entered the regional phase, this form would not be relevant.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: Form 1226CC is related to supplementary European search reports (Rule 163(4) EPC). As there was no request for international preliminary examination, and thus no supplementary European search report, this form would not apply in the given scenario.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect**: Form 1226AC indicates that the examination has started. While this might eventually occur after several communications, it does not directly address the situation of a negative WO-ISA without further amendments being filed during the international phase and upon entry into the regional phase. Therefore, Form 1226BB is more immediately relevant based on the given information.\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html"

                    "Justification": "The answer A is correct because it states that 'The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA.' According to the provided guidelines in the context, European patent applications can be filed in any language, but if filed in a non-official language (such as Spanish), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months. Since Company M has chosen to file its application with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), and given that the EPO is an international office available for filing applications under the PCT, it is permissible for Company M to choose the EPO as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and the USPTO as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). This is in line with the flexibility allowed by the PCT rules.\n\nAnswer B: This option suggests choosing the USPTO as ISA. The USPTO, being an American office, would not serve as an appropriate ISA for a Mexican filing since ISAs are typically national or regional offices where the application has been filed initially or is of significant interest. Therefore, this choice is incorrect according to the legal context.\n\nAnswer C: This option incorrectly suggests choosing the Austrian Patent Office (Austria is a contracting state of the PCT) as an ISA and the EPO as IPEA. While the EPO can serve as both ISA and IPEA, the Austrian Patent Office cannot function in this role for a Mexican filing. The choice does not align with the legal context regarding ISAs.\n\nAnswer D: This option proposes choosing the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (not an ISA) as ISA and the EPO as IPEA. Given that Singapore is indeed a PCT member, it could potentially serve as an ISA; however, it's incorrect to state that Company M can choose any office other than those specified or recognized in the PCT system as ISAs for their application. This option does not adhere to the legal framework and context provided.\n\nIn conclusion, only Answer A accurately reflects the permissible choices based on the given information and the legal context of the PCT system and EPO's role as an ISA.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html"

For EP-II filed on 7 July 2022, the priority period expired on 3 August 2023. Therefore, the applicant had until 3 October 2023 to add this missing priority claim and have it granted.\n\nGiven today’s date (12 October 2023), the time limit has already passed. Option B is incorrect because it states that the deadline for adding the priority claim from EP-II is on 7 November 2023, which exceeds the actual deadline. Options C and D are also incorrect as they suggest deadlines before today's date (12 October 2023) or an expired deadline in July 2023.\n\nThe correct answer should reflect that the time limit has passed, making it impossible for the applicant to add the missing priority claim at this point. Thus, none of the provided options accurately state this, but the closest option is B, which incorrectly states a future date as the deadline.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html"

According to Rule 51 of the EPC and the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, renewal fees that fall within the third or subsequent years can be paid up to six months before their due date without an additional fee if they were already due prior to the interruption and the period provided by paragraph 2 has not yet expired. Here, the applicant's rights have been re-established under Article 122 EPC, which means that any renewal fees for earlier applications can be paid with a six-month grace period.\n\nOption B is correct because it states that the renewal fees for the third and fourth years (which would normally fall due in July 2023 and April 2024) can be validly paid without an additional fee by October 12, 2023. This aligns with Rule 51(2)(b), which allows for a six-month grace period.\n\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Answer A**: This is incorrect because the EPC does not automatically deem an application withdrawn just because no renewal fees have been paid. The application needs to be in a state where it has lapsed due to non-payment, and this scenario involves re-establishment of rights under Article 122 EPC.\n\n- **Answer C**: This option suggests paying with an additional fee by April 30, 2024, which is too late. The guideline provided states that the renewal fees for these years can be paid without any additional fee up to six months after their due date (i.e., by October 12, 2023).\n\n- **Answer D**: This option suggests paying without an additional fee by October 31, 2023. While this is close to the deadline, it is not precise and could be seen as slightly too late based on the six-month grace period rule.\n\nIn conclusion, Answer B correctly identifies that the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without an additional fee by October 12, 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

However, these rules do not apply to the designation fee once it has been validly paid.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- **Answer A: Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report** - This option refers to a different phase of the patent application process. According to the guidelines, examination fees (not including the designation fee) may be refunded if the application is withdrawn before substantive examination begins, but this does not apply to the specific context of the designation fee.\\n\\n- **Answer B: Date of mention of the publication of the European search report** - The date of mention of the publication of the European search report marks a milestone in the process where substantive examination may begin. However, it is too late for withdrawal purposes if one wishes to seek a refund of the designation fee, as this option does not address the specific time frame for withdrawing an application without substantive examination.\\n\\n- **Answer D: Date of the start of substantive examination** - Substantive examination signifies that the patent office has started in-depth evaluation and cannot be considered the latest point for withdrawal where one would still qualify for a refund. The guidelines state that designation fees are not refundable once they have been validly paid, irrespective of when substantive examination starts.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the rules provided in the Guidelines, the applicant should recognize that the designation fee, having been validly paid, cannot be refunded at any point during or after the patent application process.

According to the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, a due date specifies the first day on which payment of a fee may be validly effected. For the renewal fee, it should not be debited from the deposit account until after its due date.\n\n- **Option A (10 October 2024)**: This is incorrect because according to the context provided in Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, even though the renewal fee was specified as non-due on this date, it should not be debited until after its due date.\n- **Option C (18 October 2024)**: This is incorrect because by 18 October 2024, the debit order has already been executed. The Guidelines indicate that if the EPO does not receive a valid debit order before the fee's due date but receives it after, the period is deemed observed as long as evidence shows it was filed with sufficient funds at the same time as the application.\n- **Option D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part)**: This option is incorrect because the Guidelines do provide for partial revocation of a debit order. Specifically, if the applicant notices an error and wants to revoke the order to debit a fee that has not yet been executed (as was the case with the renewal fee), they have until the due date minus one day (17 October 2024) to make such a change.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided guidelines and context, the latest point in time for revoking the order is 17 October 2024.

This must be done by paying the prescribed fee and making the request within two months of receiving the communication concerning the failure to observe a time limit or loss of rights. Since the applicant missed the filing deadline for the designation of inventor (as communicated pursuant to Article 90(3) EPC and Rule 60 EPC), they can file a request for further processing within two months after the date of notification of the decision, which is October 10, 2024.\n\n- **Option A (File a notice of appeal against the decision):**\n   - The Guidelines do not mention an option to appeal directly. The process for challenging decisions by the European Patent Office generally involves filing a request for further processing or re-establishment of rights first, followed by a possible appeal if necessary. Thus, appealing is not mentioned in the provided context and would typically come after attempting to rectify the situation through other means.\n\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor):**\n   - According to E-VIII, 3.1.1, re-establishment of rights is not available where further processing can be sought. Since the applicant still has the option to request further processing, they cannot also seek re-establishment of rights for the same period.\n\n- **Option D (A, B and C are correct):**\n   - As explained above, only options A and C are incorrect based on the specific context provided by E-VIII, 2. Therefore, this combination is not correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe applicant should file a request for further processing within two months of receiving the decision (Answer B), which aligns with the legal framework described in the Guidelines. Options A and C would not be applicable given the current circumstances. Option D incorrectly includes non-applicable options. Therefore, Answer B is the correct choice.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html"

Therefore, option B is correct. The guidelines do not explicitly mention a formal fee or statements of grounds as prerequisites for filing third-party observations, making options C incorrect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no indication that the person filing third-party observations will necessarily become a party to the proceedings before the EPO. Furthermore, the legal context does not obligate the applicant to respond to such third-party observations unless they are part of a formal opposition or appeal process (which is not mentioned in this question).\n\nOption D is incorrect because while it's true that observations must be filed after publication and in an official language of the EPO, the guidelines do not specifically mention these as requirements for filing third-party observations. Third-party observations can be made at any time during the examination process, provided they are within the relevant legal framework.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_3.html"

Specifically, from Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, it states that the provisional opinion on the patentability of the first-mentioned invention or unitary group of inventions 'is for information only and the applicant does not need to reply to the points raised in it.' Therefore, you are not required to file a response to this provisional opinion.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n1. **Option A:** The requirement that 'You must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024' is incorrect. According to Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, you are invited to pay a further search fee for each invention other than the one first mentioned in the claims if you want the search to cover these inventions as well. The text does not specify an exact deadline of October 25th, but rather it is within a reasonable time frame that the EPO provides (typically two months from the communication).\n\n2. **Option C:** This statement 'If you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must pay two protest fees within the time limit' is incorrect based on the provided text. There is no mention of the need to pay protest fees in the context of paying for additional searches.\n\n3. **Option D:** The claim that 'If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn' is also incorrect. According to the legal text provided, if no additional search fees are paid, only an extended European search report would not cover the additional inventions, but the application itself would not automatically be deemed withdrawn.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html"

While this text does not explicitly address the process of obtaining certified copies, it suggests that communication between different offices involved in the PCT process is necessary. In this context, it would be logical to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (Luxembourg IPR) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application directly to the EPO as per standard practice for international applications.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Answer B:** Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau would not enable it to obtain a certified copy. The DAS code is used primarily for accessing electronic documents stored in databases, and there is no indication that this method could be used to request a certified copy from another office.\n\n- **Answer C:** Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO would not be appropriate because the guidelines do not mention an option for applicants to provide their own certified copies. The process typically involves obtaining the copy from the relevant national office and then sending it through the designated or elected Office (in this case, the EPO).\n\n- **Answer D:** Filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau would be incorrect because the International Bureau is responsible for administrative matters related to the PCT process but does not handle requests for certified copies from national offices. The certified copy must come directly from the Luxembourg IPR.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate action is to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO (Answer A).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal texts, at the conclusion of opposition proceedings, if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted, then a party who opposed the patent can appeal against this decision. Since Firm C filed observations under Art. 115 EPC and not an opposition, it does not have standing to appeal the opposition division's decision (Options C and D are incorrect because they involve appeals by third parties). Option B is correct because it correctly states that at the end of the opposition proceedings, if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted, Firm B, who initially opposed the patent, can file an appeal against this decision. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Option A incorrectly suggests that Firm B would be entitled to file an appeal after a revocation decision, which contradicts the legal context where appeals can only be filed if the opposition division maintains the patent. - Options C and D involve Firm C, who is not a party to the opposition proceedings. Only the patent proprietor (Firm A) or opponents such as Firm B are parties in opposition proceedings, so they alone have the right to appeal under Art. 103(2) EPC. The relevant legal provisions from the context include: - Article 105(2) of the EPC states that a patent proprietor and opponent(s) can be parties to opposition proceedings. - Article 103(2) of the EPC provides for appeals by opponents or other qualified entities against decisions of the opposition division. Here, Firm B is an opponent who can appeal if the decision maintains the patent as granted. Therefore, option B correctly identifies that Firm B, being the party who originally opposed the patent, would be entitled to file an appeal if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html"

                    "Justification": "According to EPC Rule 51(4), if a European patent application has been refused or deemed to be withdrawn as a result of non-observance of a time limit, and if the applicant's rights are re-established under Article 122, any renewal fee that would have fallen due in the period starting on the date of the loss of rights up to and including the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights becomes due on that latter date. Additionally, EPC Rule 51(4)(a) states that this includes a renewal fee for the year of the notification plus four months.\n\nIn this scenario, EP -X-C0's unitary effect was registered on 10 October 2024, which means the proprietor's rights in the unitary patent were re-established as of that date. Therefore, any renewal fees due from the time of the loss of rights (which would be October 2023) up to and including the notification date (October 2024) became due on 10 October 2024.\n\nSince October 2024 is within four months after re-establishment, a renewal fee for the year starting from 1 November 2024 (i.e., the 5th year in this context) would be due on 31 October 2024. Hence, option B is correct.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it refers to paying a renewal fee for the 5th year by 31 October 2024, but according to EPC Rule 51(1), such fees are normally paid at the end of the relevant year (which would be in November 2024).\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it suggests paying a renewal fee for the 6th year, which is not due until after the 31 October 2024 payment period.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as no renewal fees are waived or cancelled; they must still be paid according to the rules mentioned above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mention that 'Applicants must use Use of the prescribed request for grant form (EPO Form 1001), which is available in the EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0's online filing tools (see A-II, 1.1.1A-II, 1.2.2) or can be downloaded free of charge from the EPO website (epo.org)' to meet the requirement for providing 'the indication that a patent is sought'. Additionally, the text on fees and payment methods mentions information relating to fees and methods of payment, including 'the EPO bank account for payments in euro, can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org) under: Applying for a patent/Fees', which implies access through MyEPO Portfolio. Furthermore, the Mailbox is mentioned as part of the services that can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- Answer A includes 'A shared area with examiners' and 'European Patent Register'. These functionalities are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text or context as being available through MyEPO Portfolio. The European Patent Register is a part of the EPO's public database, which users can access but is not specified to be directly accessible via MyEPO Portfolio.\n- Answer B includes 'replying to a communication under Article 94(3) EPC'. While this may be a functionality related to MyEPO Portfolio, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text or context. The text does discuss communication and replies but does not specifically state that these are directly accessible via MyEPO Portfolio.\n- Answer C includes 'patent search via publication server', which is an accurate service available through EPO's public systems, but again, this functionality is not specified to be part of the services directly accessible via MyEPO Portfolio according to the provided text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_1.html"

This service allows applicants to submit documents even during such outages to ensure that their application process remains uninterrupted.\n\n- **Option A: When you submit documents after business hours** - The Guidelines do not specifically mention using the Contingency Upload Service for submissions made after regular business hours. Standard procedures are typically sufficient for document submission outside of normal working times, and there is no indication in the provided context that the Contingency Upload Service is necessary or recommended for such instances.\n\n- **Option B: When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end** - The Guidelines do not provide any guidance suggesting that the Contingency Upload Service should be used when there is a technical issue on the applicant's side. Standard procedures and possibly direct contact with the EPO support team would be more appropriate in such cases.\n\n- **Option D: When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday** - The Guidelines do not mention using the Contingency Upload Service during holidays or closures of the EPO. In this case, the standard filing systems should remain accessible and functional unless there is a broader system outage as described in Option C.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided legal context, the correct answer is that the EPO recommends using the EPO Contingency Upload Service when there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via the standard filing systems (Option C).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_10.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 3.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_3_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "Answer C is correct because it aligns with the guidelines provided in the EPO's Guidelines for Examination. According to the text from A-III, 14, European patent applications can be filed in any language, including Finnish. If an application is initially filed in a non-official language (such as Finnish), the applicant must provide a translation into one of the official languages within two months of filing. The text states that amendments to the application or patent have to be filed in the language of the proceedings, which can be a non-official language if the applicant chooses it. In this case, Korhonen initially filed the application in Finnish and provided an English translation as required.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while it suggests filing amended claims in Finnish with a subsequent translation into any official language, there are no such provisions that allow for using any official language other than English (which was already provided) for translations. The text specifically mentions that Rule 6(1) requires the translation to be submitted into one of the three official languages: English, French or German.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it incorrectly states that Korhonen is not allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish at all. This is contrary to the EPO’s policy as stated in A-VII, 1.1, which allows applicants like Korhonen who are resident in Finland and thus may be more comfortable using their native language (Finnish) when filing applications.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it incorrectly demands that after providing a translation into English (which was already done), another translation must be provided. According to the guidelines, only one translation is required if the application has been initially filed in a non-official language. Thus, once Korhonen has provided an English translation as part of his initial filing, he does not need to provide another translation for further amendments unless it specifically involves submitting material in a different official language which was not part of the original or amended filings.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

However, it does not specifically mention the need for a translation to one of the official languages.\n\n- **Answer B** is incorrect because an EP (European) application can be considered as the priority application, which already meets the language requirement of being in one of the official EPO languages (French). Therefore, no additional translation would be required. \n\n- **Answer C** could potentially be correct if we consider that an international application filed with the EPO in English and subsequently filed in English using Online Filing 2.0 does not require any further translation, thus meeting the criteria for PCT Direct.\n\n- **Answer D** is incorrect because the guidelines do not specify that amended claims must always be filed with a PCT Direct letter.

However, the official languages are specifically defined by the EPO and not tied to the number of signatories or states. The official languages of the EPO are English, French, and German.\n- Option D is incorrect because it suggests a translation into Spanish.
