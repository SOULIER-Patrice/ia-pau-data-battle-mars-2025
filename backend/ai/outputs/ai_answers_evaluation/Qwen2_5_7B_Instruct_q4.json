            "Question": "A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC is dated 7 December 2022. In the communication a time limit of four months is set for replying to objections raised by the examining division.  Which of the following statements is not  correct?\n A.  The communication is deemed to be delivered on 17 December 2022\nB. The time limit for replying to the communication expires on 17 April 2023\nC.  Further processing for replying to the communication can be validly requested on 19 June 2023 at the latest\nD.  An extension of the time limit for filing the reply can be validly requested on 14 April 2023",
            "Answer": "Answer: C\n\nJustification: The question was which of the following statements  is not correct. Statements A, B, D  are correct. Statement C is not correct  because further  processing can be requested later than 19 June 2023, namely within  two months of a loss -of-right communication. Legal basis Rule 126(2) EPC Where notification is effected by registered letter , the letter shall be deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day  following its handover to the postal service provider unless it has failed to reach the addressee or has reached him at a later date . Rule 135(1) EPC Further processing under  Article 121, paragraph  1, shall be requested by payment of the prescribed fee within two months of the communication concerni ng either the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of rights . The omitted act shall be completed within the period for making the request. Rule 132(2) EPC In special cases, the period may be extended upon request, presented before the expiry of such  period . ",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: C.\n\n**Justification:** \n- **Statement A**: This statement is correct according to Rule 126(2) EPC, which states that where notification is effected by registered letter, the letter is deemed to be delivered to the addressee ten days after being handed over to the postal service provider. Therefore, the communication would be deemed delivered on 17 December 2022.\n- **Statement B**: This statement is also correct as the time limit for replying to the communication is four months from 7 December 2022, which indeed expires on 17 April 2023.\n- **Statement D**: This statement is correct as per Rule 132(2) EPC, which allows for extensions of time limits on request made before the expiry of the period set. Thus, an extension could be requested up until 14 April 2023.\n- **Statement C**: This statement is incorrect. According to Rule 135(1) EPC, further processing under Article 121, paragraph 1, shall be requested by payment of the prescribed fee within two months of the communication concerning the failure to observe a time limit or a loss of rights. Since the communication was issued on 7 December 2022, the deadline for requesting further processing would be 7 June 2023, not 19 June 2023.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**  \n- Option A aligns with the delivery rules specified in Rule 126(2) EPC.\n- Option B correctly calculates the expiration date using the four-month period mentioned in the communication.\n- Option D adheres to the provisions allowing for extensions of time limits as stated in Rule 132(2) EPC, which permits requests to be made before the expiry of the period set.\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_2_5.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

No sequence listing was filed.  Which of the following statements is correct?\n A. If you are invited by the EPO to file a sequence listing, you need to file it and pay a late furnishing fee to the EPO\nB. If you are invited by the EPO to file a sequence listing and do not react to this invitation in due time, the application is deemed to be withdrawn\nC. If you are invited by the EPO to file a sequence listing, you need to file it in PDF format\nD. You do not need to file any sequence listing because the amino acid sequence is not claimed",
            "Answer": "Answer: A\n\nJustification: Legal basis Rule 30(3) EPC Where the applicant has not filed a sequence listing complying with the requirements under  paragraph  1 at the date of filing, the European Patent Office shall invite the applicant to furnish such a sequence listing and pay the late furnishing fee . If the applicant does not furnish the required sequence listing and pay the required late furnishing fee within a period of two months after such an invitation, the application shall be refused . Decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 December 2021 on the filing of sequence listings , Article  1(1) If nucleotide or amino acid sequences are disclosed in a European patent application, the description must contain a sequence listing in XML  format complying with WIPO Standard  ST.26.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: A.\n\n**Justification:** According to Rule 30(3) EPC, if the applicant has not filed a sequence listing complying with the requirements at the date of filing, the European Patent Office shall invite the applicant to furnish such a sequence listing and pay the late furnishing fee. If the applicant does not comply with this request within the specified period, the application will be refused (Option A).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option B is incorrect because the application would not be deemed withdrawn if the applicant fails to respond to the EPO’s invitation; instead, the application would be refused.\n- Option C is incorrect because the sequence listing must be filed in electronic form, specifically in XML format as per WIPO Standard ST.26, not in PDF format.\n- Option D is incorrect because even though the amino acid sequence is not claimed, it still needs to be included in the sequence listing if it is disclosed in the application, especially since it is used in an example.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-II, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_ii_6_1.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_5.html\nSource: EPC Rule 30, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r30.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_4_2.html"

Date  of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent\nC. Date of notification of the decision to grant\nD. Date of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC",
            "Answer": "Answer: A\n\nJustification: Legal basis Board of Appeal  decision  G12/91 Guidelines for Examination in the EPO , H-VI, 2.1 : The decision -making process  is terminated on the date of handing over of the decision to grant to the EPO 's postal service . 2 ",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** According to Rule 139 EPC, linguistic errors, errors of transcription, and mistakes in any document filed with the European Patent Office may be corrected on request. Specifically, for corrections concerning the description, claims, or drawings, the correction must be obvious in the sense that it is immediately evident that nothing else would have been intended than what is offered as the correction. However, there is no explicit mention of a deadline tied to the granting process in Rule 139 itself. \n\nGiven the context provided, the most relevant guidance comes from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, which states that requests for such corrections may be made at any time, provided that proceedings are pending before the EPO (see J 42/92). This implies that corrections can generally be requested up until the final stages of the examination process.\n\nOption B, \"Date of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent,\" aligns best with this principle because it suggests that the correction can be made right up to the very end of the examination process, just before the patent is granted. Once the patent is granted and published, the opportunity for correction typically ends.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A (\"One day before the decision to grant a European patent is handed over to the EPO postal service\") is too specific and not supported by the guidelines. It introduces a deadline that isn't mentioned in the rules.\n- Option C (\"Date of notification of the decision to grant\") is close but still too early. Corrections can be made post-notification but before the patent is actually granted.\n- Option D (\"Date of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC\") refers to a different rule and doesn’t specifically address the timing for correcting errors in the claims or other parts of the application.\nContext: \nSource: EPC Rule 139, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r139.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_v_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 133, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r133.html\nSource: EPC Rule 140, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r140.html\nSource: EPC Rule 58, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r58.html"

Antonia can validly file EP -A with the EPO\nD. None of the above",
            "Answer": "Answer: C\n\nJustification: Legal basis States party to the PCT and the Paris Convention and m embers of the World Trade Organization (wipo.int) : Argentina is not a PCT contracting state Article 58 EPC A European patent application may be filed by any natural or legal person, or anybody equivalent to a legal person by virtue of the law governing  it. ",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** According to the provided context, Antonia can validly file her international patent application PCT-A with the EPO because she is an Argentine citizen and the language of her application (Argentine Spanish) is considered an \"admissible non-EPO language.\" The context specifies that applications can be filed in any language, including those that are not official EPO languages like Spanish, provided they meet certain conditions, such as being the official language of a contracting state or the applicant's residence or principal place of business being within the territory of a contracting state that recognizes the language.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A is incorrect because while the International Bureau of WIPO handles initial filings for PCT applications, the context does not indicate that filing directly with WIPO would be valid for an application in a non-official EPO language.\n- Option C is incorrect because EP-A refers to a European patent application filed directly with the EPO, and although Antonia meets the criteria for filing in Spanish, the context specifically mentions that filing a European patent application in a single language is not a requirement for obtaining a filing date. Therefore, filing EP-A directly with the EPO without a translation might not be necessary or required.\n- Option D is incorrect since option B provides a valid statement based on the information given.\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_4_3.html"

Only statement I is correct\nB. Only statement II is correct\nC. Both statements I and II are correct\nD. Both statements I and II are incorrect",

Rule 51(2) EPC If a renewal fee is not paid on the due date under  paragraph 1 , the fee may still be paid within six months of the said date, i.e . on 28 February 2023, provided that an additional fee is also paid within that period . Rule 51(3) EPC Renewal fees already due  for an earlier application at the date  of filing a divisional application  are due on its filing, i.e . on 26 September 2022.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: D.\n\n**Justification:** \n- **Statement I**: The renewal fee for the fourth year for EP-X was indeed due on 31 August 2022, as per Rule 51(1) of the EPC, which states that the renewal fee is due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the filing date. Since EP-X was filed on 23 August 2019, the fourth-year renewal fee would be due on 31 August 2022. However, Statement I incorrectly states that the renewal fees for both the third and fourth years for EP-Y were due on 26 September 2022. According to the guidelines, the third-year renewal fee for EP-Y should be due on 31 August 2022 (the anniversary of EP-X’s filing date), and the fourth-year renewal fee for EP-Y would be due on 26 September 2023 (the anniversary of EP-Y’s filing date).\n\n- **Statement II**: The renewal fee for the fourth year for EP-X can be validly paid up to six months before it falls due, i.e., until 31 February 2023, which aligns with Rule 51(1). Therefore, paying the fourth-year renewal fee for EP-X on 28 February 2023 along with the necessary additional fee is correct. However, Statement II incorrectly states that the renewal fees for the third and fourth years for EP-Y can be validly paid without an additional fee up to 31 January 2023. According to the guidelines, the third-year renewal fee for EP-Y could be paid without an additional fee up to 31 August 2022, and the fourth-year renewal fee for EP-Y could be paid without an additional fee up to 26 March 2023.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A (\"Only statement I is correct\") is incorrect because Statement II contains inaccuracies regarding the timing for paying the renewal fees for EP-Y.\n- Option B (\"Only statement II is correct\") is incorrect because Statement I contains inaccuracies regarding the timing for paying the renewal fees for EP-Y.\n- Option C (\"Both statements I and II are correct\") is incorrect because both statements contain inaccuracies related to the timing for paying the renewal fees for EP-Y.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 86, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a86.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

            "Answer": "Answer: D\n\nJustification: The invitation was received ten days after the mailing date , i.e. three days later than the seven days stipulated in Rule  80.6 PCT, so the period expires three days later than two months from the mailing date , that is, on 5 February 2023, which is a Sunday. The final date for responding is therefore  6 February 2023 (Monday). Legal basis Rule 80.6 PCT […] Irrespective of the date  on which such a document or letter  was mailed, if the applicant offers  to the national Office or intergovernmental organization  evidence which satisfies th e national Office or intergovernmental organization  that the document or letter  was received more than seven days after the date it bears , the national Office or intergovernmental organization  shall treat the period starting from the date  of the document or letter  as expiring later by an additional number  of days which is equal to the number  of days which the document or letter  was received later  than seven days after the date it bears . 3 Rule 80.5(i) PCT If the expiration of any period during which any document or fee  must reach a national Office or intergovernmental organization  falls on a day  […] on which such Office or organization is not open to the public  for the purposes of the transaction of official business  […] the period shall expire  on the next subsequent day on which [ no such  circumstance] exists .

The invitation was dated 2 December 2022 and received by the applicant on 12 December 2022. \n\nTo calculate the deadline, we add two months to the date of receipt:\n\n- Date of receipt: 12 December 2022\n- Adding 2 months: 12 December 2022 + 2 months = 12 February 2023\n\nHowever, since 12 February 2023 is a Sunday, the deadline would typically be extended to the next business day, which is Monday, 13 February 2023. But considering the standard practice in patent procedures, the exact date when the period expires is usually taken as the last day of the extended period, which in this case is 12 February 2023 plus two full months, leading us to conclude that the final date for responding to the invitation is 5 February 2023 (assuming the extension rule applies).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A (2 February 2023) is too early.\n- Option B (13 February 2023) is likely the correct date if the extension rule strictly follows the next business day, but the context suggests the last day of the period.\n- Option D (6 February 2023) is beyond the typical extension period and not aligned with common practices in patent procedures.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and commonly applied date based on the provided context is 5 February 2023.\nContext: \nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Specifically, Rule 90.4(d) states that “any receiving Office, any International Searching Authority, any Authority competent to carry out supplementary searches, any International Preliminary Examining Authority and the International Bureau may waive the requirement under paragraph (b) that a separate power of attorney be submitted to it.” This means that for both withdrawing an international patent application (I) and filing a demand for international preliminary examination (II), the requirement to submit a power of attorney signed by each applicant may be waived.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A suggests that a power of attorney signed by each applicant is always required for both actions, which contradicts the possibility of waiver mentioned in Rule 90.4(d).\n- Options B and C suggest that a power of attorney signed by each applicant is required specifically for withdrawing an international patent application (I) or filing a demand for international preliminary examination (II), respectively. However, since the waiver provision applies to both actions, these options are not accurate.\nContext: \nSource: PCT Rule 90, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r90.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_1.html\nSource: PCT Rule 90, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r90.html"

These steps align with options A, B, and D.\n\n- Option A refers to supplying a translation, which is required if the Euro-PCT application was not published in one of the EPO’s official languages (as stated in the context).\n- Option B mentions specifying the application documents, which is indeed a mandatory step (referenced in the context).\n- Option D involves paying the search fee, which is required if a supplementary European search report needs to be drawn up (also mentioned in the context).\n\nOption C, however, specifies filing the designation of the inventor, which is not listed among the minimum requirements for entry into the European phase. The context focuses on actions like supplying translations, specifying application documents, paying fees, and requesting examinations, none of which involve designating inventors as a prerequisite.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Options A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the context as part of the minimum requirements for entry into the European phase.

Option B correctly reflects this process: the applicant can initially file the application in French and subsequently file a translation into English within the specified timeframe, thereby allowing English to become the language of the proceedings.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A**: While it might seem logical that upon entry into the European phase, the applicant could file a translation into English, the context does not support this scenario. It specifically mentions that translations must be filed within two months of the original filing date, not during the European phase.\n  \n- **Option C**: The context indicates that the language of the proceedings becomes the official language of the application once it enters the European phase. Therefore, selecting English in the request form for entry into the European phase would not change the language of the proceedings to English automatically.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: C.\n\n**Justification:** According to Rule 140 of the EPC, only linguistic errors, errors of transcription, and obvious mistakes can be corrected in decisions of the European Patent Office. The error described here—omission of page 2 of the description—is likely considered a typographical or transcriptional error rather than a substantive change to the patent's content. Since the decision to grant the patent has already been made and the patent specification has been published, correcting this omission falls under the category of correcting errors in the published specification after the grant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no absolute prohibition on correcting such errors post-grant according to the EPC rules. \nOption B is incorrect because while errors can be corrected, they need to meet specific criteria (linguistic, transcriptional, or obvious), and there isn't a blanket permission to correct them at any time.\nOption D is incorrect because the timing of when an error can be corrected does not depend on whether opposition proceedings are pending but rather on the nature of the error itself and the rules governing corrections.\n\nTherefore, the error can be corrected, but it needs to fit the criteria set out in Rule 140, making Option C the most accurate statement.\nContext: \nSource: EPC Rule 140, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r140.html\nSource: EPC Rule 139, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r139.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_7.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_10.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71.html"

Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.\n- **Option C**: Adding claims after the initial filing date is generally not allowed unless specifically permitted by law, such as under Rule 56(3) EPC when the missing parts are completely contained in a prior application. Since no such exception applies here, adding claims 7-12 would likely require amending the application, which is not typically allowed before the search report is issued.\n- **Option D**: Withdrawing and refiling the application is not necessary just because some pages are missing. The EPO allows the applicant to file the missing parts within a reasonable timeframe without needing to withdraw and refile the entire application.

Procedural Steps for Recording the Transfer of Rights**\n\n**The correct answer is:**\n- File a request for a transfer of rights using EPO Form 5050.\n- Submit written evidence suitable for proving the transfer (with the signatures of both the assignor and assignee).\n- Pay the transfer fee.\n\n**Justification:** According to the context, the application EP-F3 to be transferred must be pending at the time of transfer. Therefore, the first step is to file a request for a transfer of rights using EPO Form 5050. Written evidence suitable for proving the transfer must be submitted, which typically includes the signatures of both the assignor and assignee. Additionally, the transfer fee must be paid.\n\n**b. Validity of the Filing in Italian and Ensuring Pendency**\n\n**Under what circumstances is the filing in Italian valid?**\n- The filing in Italian is valid only if the previous applications were also filed in Italian.\n\n**What steps need to be taken and what fees need to be paid to ensure that EP-F3 remains pending?**\n- Ensure that the previous applications (EP-F2 and EP-F1) were also filed in Italian.\n- Pay the fee for further processing (50% of the relevant fees) by 14 December 2022.\n- Pay the search fee, filing fee (without reduction) according to Rule 6(4) EPC including page fee (for eight pages) and additional fee for divisional second generation.\n\n**Justification:** The filing in Italian is valid only if the previous applications were also filed in Italian. To ensure that EP-F3 remains pending, the fee for further processing must be paid by 14 December 2022, along with the necessary fees for the search, filing, and any additional fees related to the divisional application.\n\n**c. Paying the Examination Fee at the Reduced Rate**\n\n**What needs to be done if the applicants want to pay the examination fee at the reduced rate provided for in Article 14(1) of the Rules relating to Fees?**\n- After the transfer of rights (at the latest by the time of payment of the reduced examination fee), the representative of the joint applicants should send a letter to the EPO stating that both applicants A and C are entities or natural persons covered by Rule 6(4) EPC (Form 1011 can be used).\n\n\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiv_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_3.html"

            "Question": "  On 22 May 2020, applicant B filed US application US-B in English. Despite all due care being taken by applicant B, international application PCT-B claiming priority from US-B was only filed on 7 June 2021. The USPTO, acting as receiving Office, granted the applicant's request for restoration of the right of priority on the basis that the failure to file PCT-B within the priority period was unintentional.  On 9 December 2022, applicant B took all the steps required under Rule 159 EPC for PCT-B to enter the European phase before the EPO.  When did the time limit for filing the request for restoration of the right of priority at the USPTO acting as receiving Office expire? What must be done before the EPO as designated Office, and by when, to ensure that the restoration of the right of priority is effective in the European phase? ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: On 22 May 2020, the priority period expired. According to the context, the request for restoration had to be filed within two months of the date on which the priority period expired.\n\n**Time limit for filing the request for restoration of the right of priority at the USPTO:**\n- Priority period expired on 22 May 2020.\n- Two months after 22 May 2020 is 24 July 2020, extended to 26 July 2020.\n\nTherefore, the time limit for filing the request for restoration of the right of priority at the USPTO acting as receiving Office expired on 26 July 2020.\n\n**What must be done before the EPO as designated Office, and by when, to ensure that the restoration of the right of priority is effective in the European phase:**\n\n- **Request for restoration of priority must be filed within one month of the date on which the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase expired.**\n- **The 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase expired on 22 December 2022 (22 May 2020 + 31 months).**\n- **One month after 22 December 2022 is 22 January 2023, extended to 23 January 2023.**\n\nThus, the applicant must file the request for restoration of the right of priority with the EPO by 23 January 2023 to ensure that the restoration of the right of priority is effective in the European phase.\n\n**The correct answer is: D. 23 January 2023**\n\n**Justification:** \n- The USPTO granted the request for restoration of the right of priority based on the \"unintentional criterion,\" meaning the request does not need to be resubmitted to the EPO.\n- The EPO recognizes decisions made by the receiving Office regarding unintentional failures unless there is reasonable doubt about the requirements for granting the restoration.\n- Therefore, the key deadlines are the original USPTO deadline (26 July 2020) and the subsequent EPO deadline (23 January 2023).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Any date before 26 July 2020 would not\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_3.html\nSource: 2022_MOCK_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

            "Question": "  Your client CoffeeBreak filed a European patent application claiming a new type of coffee maker on 20 December 2021 but withdrew it before search. CoffeeBreak then asked you to file an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application and with no amendments compared to that application. The priority application contains drawings that are essential for understanding the invention.  On 5 December 2022, you filed an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application at the International Bureau, using PCT/RO/101. Your colleague handling a patent application for shoe soles left by mistake his drawings in your filing folder. Therefore, you filed the wrong drawings with the international patent application claiming the coffee maker instead of the correct drawings.  a. You discover your mistake today, 12 December 2022. Assuming that the International Bureau does not detect the wrong drawings, what actions can you take of your own volition to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. b. You do not discover your mistake until receiving a PCT/RO/107 notification dated 4 January 2023 from the International Bureau. What actions can you take to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. c.

You only find out about the mistake on 27 April 2023 after receiving the written opinion. The invention has not been and will not be made public by any means other than publication by the International Bureau. You intend to withdraw the international patent application before publication and file a new international patent application with the correct drawings.  d. Will you still be in time to prevent publication of the first international patent application? Please give reasons for your answer. ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: ### Part (a)\n\n**Actions:**\n- File a corrected version of the international patent application including the correct drawings.\n\n**Time Limit:**\n- Two months from the original filing date, i.e., by 5 February 2023.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nAccording to Rule 20(6) PCT, you need to confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference. Since the mistake was discovered before the International Bureau detected it, you can correct the application within the two-month period starting from the original filing date (5 December 2022).\n\n### Part (b)\n\n**Actions:**\n- File a corrected version of the international patent application including the correct drawings.\n\n**Time Limit:**\n- Two months from the date indicated in the PCT/RO/107 notification, i.e., by 6 March 2023.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIf you did not discover the mistake until receiving the PCT/RO/107 notification on 4 January 2023, you have another two months from that date to correct the application. This aligns with the general rule that any corrections should be made within two months of becoming aware of the error.\n\n### Part (c)\n\n**Scenario without Claiming Priority:**\n\n**Part (a):**\n- No action needed since the application would not claim priority and thus the original filing date would not be maintained.\n\n**Part (b):**\n- No action needed since the application would not claim priority and thus the original filing date would not be maintained.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nIf you had not claimed priority, the original filing date would not be preserved, and the application would be treated as a new filing. Therefore, correcting the drawings would not affect the filing date, and no specific time limits related to maintaining the original filing date would apply.\n\n### Part (d)\n\n**Answer:**\nNo, you will not be in time to prevent publication of the first international patent application.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nPublication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, which is after 20 June 2023. Withdrawing the application after 27 April 2023 means that the application will already have passed the 18-month mark, leading to its automatic publication.

            "Question": "  On 10 December 2021, your client, a large Romanian company, filed a Romanian national patent application RO-H. RO-H is drafted in Romanian and comprises 32 pages of description and drawings, and four pages with 15 claims. Your client has informed you that they will prepare and forward an English translation of RO-H in due course. This will comprise 29 pages of description and drawings, four pages with 15 claims and an abstract comprising two pages. Your client wants you to file today, 12 December 2022, a European patent application EP-H drafted in Romanian and claiming priority of RO-H.  a.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: **a. What fees have to be paid and what would be the last date for paying them?**\n\n**The correct answer is: C.**\n- **Justification:** According to the context, the filing fee and the search fee should be paid within one month of filing, which is by 12 January 2023. Additionally, the filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (since the application is 32 pages long, including the abstract, which counts as one page, making it 33 pages total, but the fee calculation starts from 36 pages, hence 2 extra pages).\n\n**b. You filed an automatic debit order for EP-H. On the decisive payment date, you receive an email from the EPO informing you that there are insufficient funds in your deposit account to cover any of the fees to be paid (as identified in your answer to question (a)). You replenish the account two days after receiving the email. Do you have to take any further action to ensure these fees are paid?**\n\n**The correct answer is: D. No action is required.**\n- **Justification:** The context states that the payment is deemed to have been made on the date when the account was duly replenished. Therefore, once the account is replenished, the fees are considered paid.\n\n**c. What is the time limit for filing an English translation of the application via the EPO's online services? What is the consequence for the time limit if, on the last day of the period for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services which prevents you from filing it? The outage lasts for the whole of that day.**\n\n**The correct answer is: C.**\n- **Justification:** The context indicates that a translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application. For the current scenario, this would be 12 December 2022 + 2 months = 12 February 2023. If there is an unplanned outage preventing submission on the last day, the period extends to the next working day, which would be 13 February 2023. Hence, the translation could still be filed on 13 February 2023 without any consequences.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A suggests immediate cancellation, which is incorrect because the context does not indicate any automatic cancellation upon insufficient funds\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

            "Question": "  Applicant A filed European patent application EP-A1 in English in May 2019. It describes two different inventions, X and Y, and claims invention X only. The European search report was drawn up for invention X only. A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting a time limit of four months for response was issued by the EPO on 16 May 2022. A two-month extension of this time limit was granted on 26 September 2022. As of today's date, no response has been filed. Applicant A is now interested in invention Y. Today, 12 December 2022, he files a European divisional application EP-A2 based on EP-A1 and describing invention Y. No fees were paid, and no claims were submitted at the time of filing.  What does applicant A have to do to have invention Y searched by the EPO?",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To have invention Y searched by the EPO, applicant A needs to follow these steps:\n\n- **File a request for examination**: According to EPC Rule 70, the applicant must file a request for examination of the European patent application up to six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.\n\n- **Submit necessary documentation**: Applicant A should submit the description, claims, and drawings related to invention Y. These elements are essential for the EPO to conduct a proper search and examination.\n\n- **Pay the required fees**: Applicant A will need to pay the search fee and, subsequently, the examination fee. The search fee is typically refunded if certain conditions are met, such as meeting the criteria outlined in Art. 9(2) RFees, but since this condition applies to divisional applications filed on or after April 1, 2022, it might not be applicable here unless the original application meets those criteria.\n\n### Justification:\n- **EPC Rule 70**: This rule mandates that the applicant must request examination of the European patent application within six months of the publication of the search report. Since the search report was drawn up for invention X, the applicant can now request examination for invention Y within the next six months.\n- **Divisional Application**: By filing a divisional application, the applicant has already initiated the process for examining invention Y. However, the divisional application itself does not automatically trigger a search without a specific request for examination.\n- **Documentation Submission**: The description, claims, and drawings for invention Y must be provided to the EPO to allow them to perform the search.\n- **Fees Payment**: While the divisional application was filed without paying fees, the EPO will require the payment of the search fee before proceeding with the search. Once the search is completed, the fee for examination would then be due.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **Automatic Search**: There is no automatic mechanism for searching a divisional application upon filing; a specific request for examination must be made.\n- **No Additional Fees**: Although the divisional application was filed without fees, the EPO still requires the payment of the search fee to proceed with the search of invention Y.\n\nTherefore, the correct action for applicant A is to file a request for examination along with the necessary documentation and fees for invention Y.\nContext: \nSource: EPC Rule 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r70.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_8.html\nSource: EPC Article 78, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a78.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: D.\n\n**Justification:** According to EPC Rule 21(1), an incorrect designation of an inventor can be rectified upon request and only with the consent of the wrongly designated person and, where such a request is filed by a third party, the consent of the applicant for or proprietor of the patent.

            "Answer": "Answer: A\n\nJustification: Legal basis R epresentative X is a representative according to article 134.1 EPC and is already registered as representative for the European patent application EP -A, so any registration of change in representation by a new European patent atorney necessitates an authorization for representation signed by the applicant to be validly registered by the EPO. According to rule 152(1) EPC, The President of the European Patent Offi ce shall determine the cases in which a signed authorization shall be ﬁled by representatives acting before the European Patent Office. In decision of the President of the EPO of 12.07.2007 on the ﬁling of authorizations (Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2 007, L.1), (2) If the European Patent Office is informed of a change of representative involving professional representatives who are not members of the same association, without being notiﬁed that the previous representative's authorization has terminate d, the new representative must ﬁle, together with the notiﬁcation of his appointment, an individual authorization (original and one copy) or a reference to a general authorization already on ﬁle If an authorization for representation is not provided, an y acts done by the “new” representative will be deemed to never have occurred by the EPO.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: A.\n\n**Justification:** \nAccording to the context provided, when there is a change in representation involving different professional representatives who are not members of the same association, the new representative must file an individual authorization (original and one copy) or a reference to a general authorization already on file along with the notification of his appointment. This requirement ensures that the change in representation is valid and recognized by the EPO. Additionally, the new representative needs to respond to the written opinion (extended European search report) within the stipulated time frame, which is 6 months from the publication date of the EESR plus 6 months. Given that the EESR was published on 12 April 2023, the deadline for responding to the search opinion is 12 October 2023.\n\nOption A correctly states all these requirements: new representative Y should request a change of representative, file a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest, and also file an authorisation signed by the applicant in good time. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option B omits the requirement for the applicant to sign an authorization, which is crucial for validating the change in representation.\n- Option C incorrectly extends the deadline for filing the response to the extended European search report beyond the stipulated 12 October 2023.\n- Option D includes an incorrect deadline for filing the response to the extended European search report and again omits the requirement for the applicant to sign an authorization.\nContext: \nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Article 92, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a92.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html"

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** The guidelines indicate that re-establishment of rights can be requested when an applicant fails to observe a time limit that results in the refusal of the European patent application, the deeming of the application as withdrawn, or the revocation of the patent. Among the options provided:\n\n- **Option A (Time limit for paying the designation fee)**: According to the document, missing the deadline for paying the designation fee leads to the European patent application being deemed withdrawn. Thereafter, re-establishment of rights would not be allowed because the application has already been deemed withdrawn.\n- **Option B (Time limit for requesting examination)**: Missing this time limit could result in the refusal of the application, making re-establishment of rights applicable.\n- **Option C (Time limit for filing the application within the priority period)**: Filing outside the priority period typically does not lead to the refusal of the application but rather affects the priority claim. Therefore, this scenario generally does not involve re-establishment of rights.\n- **Option D (Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights)**: Paying such a fee after the deadline would fall under the category of fee payments lacking a legal basis, leading to a refund rather than re-establishment of rights.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A is incorrect because once the application is deemed withdrawn, re-establishment of rights is not possible.\n- Option C pertains to the priority period, which does not typically trigger re-establishment of rights.\n- Option D involves a fee payment issue, not a time limit for which re-establishment of rights is sought.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_v_2.html"

Hassan is entitled to act before the DPMA  but he is not a European patent attorney. Greta and Hassan are resident in Germany.  Which of the following statements is not correct?\n A. Hassan can represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority for PCT -G.\nB. In order for Hassan to be able to act before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority , he needs to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta.\nC. According to the provisions of the PCT, it is mandatory that the d emand for international preliminary examination is signed by Greta or Hassan.\nD. According to the provisions of the PCT, an international application can only be withdrawn by the applicant or an agent appointed by a power of attorney.",
            "Answer": "Answer: B\n\nJustification: Legal basis Rule 90.4(d) PCT Subject to paragraph (e), any receiving Office, any International Searching Authority, any Authority competent to carry out supplementary searches, any International Preliminary Examining Authority and the International Bureau may waive the requirement under paragraph (b) that a separate power of attorney be submitted to it, in which case paragraph (c) shall not apply.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: C.\n\n**Justification:** \n- According to PCT Article 49, any attorney, patent agent, or other person having the right to practice before the national office with which the international application was filed is entitled to practice before the International Bureau and the competent authorities in respect of that application. Since Hassan is already entitled to practice before the DPMA, he would be eligible to act before the EPO as the International Searching Authority for PCT-G without needing additional authorization. This makes statement A correct.\n\n- Statement B is also correct because according to the PCT rules, a representative must have a power of attorney to act on behalf of the applicant before the EPO. Without such documentation, Hassan would not be authorized to act.\n\n- Statement D is correct as per the PCT regulations, an international application can only be withdrawn by the applicant or an agent appointed by a power of attorney, ensuring proper representation and authority.\n\n- Statement C is incorrect. There is no requirement in the PCT that the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed specifically by either the applicant or an agent appointed by a power of attorney. The demand process involves various forms and declarations, but signing requirements vary and typically do not mandate specific individuals like the applicant or a named agent. Thus, this statement does not align with the PCT provisions.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A correctly reflects the entitlement of a practicing attorney before the filing office to act internationally.\n- Option B accurately represents the necessity of a power of attorney for representation before the EPO.\n- Option D correctly identifies the procedural rule regarding withdrawal of an international application.\nContext: \nSource: PCT Article 49, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a49.html\nSource: Case Law II, D.2.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_d_2_2_3.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_3_1.html\nSource: PCT Article 9, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a9.html"

            "Answer": "Answer: D\n\nJustification: Legal basis Art. 14(4) EPC: “Natural or legal persons having their residence or principal place of business within a Contracting State having a language other than English, French or German as an official language, and nationals of that State who are resident abroad, may file documents which have to be filed within a time limit in an official language of that State.”",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** \nAccording to Rule 6(3) EPC, certain categories of applicants are eligible for a fee reduction when filing a European patent application or request for examination, including microenterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises, natural persons, non-profit organizations, universities, or public research organizations. Option B describes a situation where both a German firm (which qualifies as a small or medium-sized enterprise) and a natural person (who meets the criteria as a natural person) jointly file a European patent application in Dutch, an admissible non-EPO language. This scenario fits the conditions outlined in Rule 6(3) EPC, thus entitling them to a fee reduction.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- **Option A**: While the applicant is a natural person resident in Andorra and of Andorran nationality, they are not specified as being part of a microenterprise, SME, or meeting another criterion listed in Rule 6(3) EPC. Therefore, they would not qualify for the fee reduction.\n- **Option C**: The applicant is a natural person resident in the USA but of Belgian nationality, which does not meet the criteria for a fee reduction under Rule 6(3) EPC.\n- **Option D**: The applicant is a natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality, which again does not fit the criteria for a fee reduction under Rule 6(3) EPC.\nContext: \nSource: EPC Rule 7a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r7a.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6.html"

Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP -div together with a request for re- establishment of rights.",
            "Answer": "Answer: D\n\nJustification: Legal basis R36(2), R135(2) EPC The English translation of the application documents must  be ﬁled within 2 months of ﬁling the DA.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** According to the provided context, if a required translation is not filed in due time, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn (Art. 14(2) EPC; cf. Art. 90(3) EPC 1973 and J 18/01). The context further explains that the EPO will notify the applicant of this loss of rights according to Rule 112(1). Therefore, Mr Van Holland can remedy the deficiency by filing an English translation of EP-div within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A is incorrect because the context indicates that the deficiency can indeed be remedied by filing the missing translation within the stipulated timeframe.\n- Option C is incorrect because no specific mention is made about needing to file both an English translation and a request for further processing simultaneously. The context focuses on the need to file the translation first.\n- Option D is incorrect because there is no indication that re-establishment of rights would be necessary for this scenario.

The renewal fee for the fourth year can be validly paid without any additional fee until 16 January 2024 at the latest .",

Time limit: 2 months of publication of grant in the European Patent Bulletin: 8 January 2014",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** \nBased on the provided context, the renewal fee for the fourth year should be paid centrally to the EPO as long as the patent is still considered an international application when the mention of its grant is published. Since the communication about granting the patent was received today, 12 October 2023, and the original filing date of the application was 16 November 2020, we need to determine the due date for the fourth-year renewal fee.\n\nAccording to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the renewal fee for the coming year is due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the European patent application’s filing date. For the fourth year, the anniversary would be 16 November 2023. Therefore, the due date for the fourth-year renewal fee is 30 November 2023.\n\nOption B correctly identifies both these points: the renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid centrally to the EPO, and the due date is 30 November 2023.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A incorrectly states the due date as 16 November 2023, which is too early according to the guidelines.\n- Options C and D suggest that the renewal fee needs to be paid separately in each state, which is incorrect because the patent is still an international application when granted.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: D.\n\n**Justification:** According to the guidelines provided in the context, European patent applications can be filed in any language, including Spanish, but if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French, or German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing. Since the application was filed in Spanish, a translation into English must be provided.\n\nRegarding the International Searching Authority (ISA) and International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), the applicant can choose the EPO as both the ISA and the IPEA because the EPO accepts applications in any language, including Spanish, and provides translations when necessary. Therefore, option D, which selects the EPO as both the ISA and the IPEA, is correct.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A suggests the USPTO as ISA and the EPO as IPEA. While the USPTO can act as the ISA, the EPO would typically be chosen as the IPEA since it handles translations and examinations for European patents.\n- Option B suggests the USPTO as ISA and the EPO as IPEA, which is similar to option A and thus incorrect for the same reason.\n- Option C suggests the Austrian Patent Office as ISA and the EPO as IPEA. While the Austrian Patent Office can act as the ISA, the EPO would still be the preferred choice for the IPEA role, especially considering the need for translation services.\n\nThus, the most appropriate combination ensuring proper handling of the application, including translation needs, is the EPO acting as both the ISA and the IPEA.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html"

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: C.\n\n**Justification:** \nAccording to Rule 51(2) of the European Patent Convention, if a renewal fee is not paid on the due date, it may still be paid within six months of the said date, provided that an additional fee is also paid within that period. In this case, since the renewal fees for the third and fourth years were due before the interruption of proceedings, they remain due even after the proceedings were resumed. Given that the application was interrupted on 10 March 2022 and the applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed on 12 October 2023, we need to determine when these renewal fees became due again.\n\n- The filing date of the application is 20 March 2020.\n- The third year starts on 20 March 2021 and ends on 19 March 2022.\n- The fourth year starts on 20 March 2022 and ends on 19 March 2023.\n\nSince the application was interrupted on 10 March 2022, the third-year renewal fee would have become due on 10 March 2023, and the fourth-year renewal fee would have become due on 10 March 2024. However, because the application was resumed on 12 October 2023, the due dates for both the third and fourth years shift forward accordingly.\n\n- Third-year renewal fee now due on 12 October 2023.\n- Fourth-year renewal fee now due on 12 October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest, making statement C correct.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A is incorrect because the application is not deemed withdrawn just because no renewal fees have been paid.\n- Option B is incorrect because the renewal fees cannot be paid without an additional fee beyond the initial six-month period.\n- Option D is incorrect because the renewal fees for the fourth year cannot be paid without an additional fee by 31 October 2023, as the fourth-year renewal fee becomes due on 12 October 2024.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

Please explain whether the supplementary Eur opean search can start earlier and list the necessary steps  to ensure the earliest possible start at minimum cost. You should identify the fees due to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts. ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The supplementary European search can indeed start earlier than waiting 31 months from the filing date. According to the guidelines provided:\n\n- **Necessary Steps:**\n  1. **Explicitly Waive Right to Communications Pursuant to Rules 161(2) and 162(2):** To avoid delays caused by the six-month communication period, the applicant must explicitly waive their rights to these communications. This can be done through a formal declaration or by ticking a specific checkbox on the relevant forms when entering the European phase.\n\n  2. **Pay Any Claims Fees Due:** The applicant needs to pay any claims fees due to initiate the supplementary European search process promptly. This includes fees related to the European phase of the PCT application.\n\n- **Fees Due:**\n  - **Claims Fee:** This covers the number of claims included in the application. Since there are 15 claims, the applicant needs to pay the appropriate claims fee.\n  - **Search Fee:** This fee initiates the supplementary European search. The exact amount depends on the complexity of the application, but it typically covers the initial search effort.\n\nBy taking these steps, the applicant ensures that the supplementary European search starts as early as possible, avoiding unnecessary delays associated with the six-month communication period under Rule 161(2).\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Waiving Communications (Rule 161(2) and 162(2))**: By waiving the right to communications, the applicant bypasses the mandatory six-month period during which the EPO would normally communicate with them about the international search report and the search opinion. This allows the EPO to proceed directly to drafting the supplementary European search report.\n- **Payment of Fees**: Paying the necessary fees ensures that the EPO can begin processing the application for the supplementary European search without delay. These fees cover both the administrative costs and the technical work involved in conducting the search.\n\nThus, the supplementary European search can start earlier than the 31-month mark, and the key actions are explicitly waiving communications and paying the required fees.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: 2022_MOCK_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_3.html"

Procedural Steps and Actions\n\nTo get the first communication under Article 94(3) EPC or Rule 71(3) EPC as soon as possible:\n\n- **Translation of Claims**: File translations of the claims into English and German within two months of the filing date of the European application.\n- **Designation Fees**: Pay the designation fees for the countries where protection is sought (BE, LV, and MT) within six months of the publication of the search report.\n\n### Justification:\n- **Translation Requirement**: According to the guidelines, translations of the claims must be filed within two months of the filing date of the European application (10 June 2022). This ensures compliance with the requirement for obtaining a communication under Article 94(3) EPC or Rule 71(3) EPC.\n- **Designation Fees**: The designation fees fall due upon publication of the search report, which occurred on 11 October 2023. These fees must be paid within six months of the publication date to avoid losing rights.\n\n### 2. Deadline Calculations\n\n- **Translations**: Two months from 10 June 2022 is 10 August 2022. However, since the European application was filed later (10 June 2022), the deadline becomes two months from 10 June 2022, which is 10 August 2022. Given that the European application was filed on 10 June 2022, the actual deadline for translations is 10 August 2022.\n- **Designation Fees**: Six months from 11 October 2023 is 11 April 2024.\n\nThus, the actions must be taken by:\n- **Translations**: 10 August 2022 (but practically, it should be done as soon as possible)\n- **Designation Fees**: 11 April 2024\n\n### 3. Fees for Obtaining the Broadest Territorial Scope\n\nIf the applicant desires the broadest possible territorial scope of protection, the following fees must be paid:\n\n- **Grant and Printing Fee**: Pay the fee for grant and printing within four months of the publication of the search report (11 October 2023). This fee is due by 11 February\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_2.html"

            "Question": " Your French employer applied f or a European patent in French on 12 October 2021, without claiming any priority; the application as filed contained 10 claims. All fees that fell due before publication of the application with the search report were paid in time. In response to the search  opinion, your employer immediately requested examination and filed a set of 20 claims. The application and the amended claims were published on 19 April 2023, together with the search report. The EPO examining division has issued a communication under Rul e 71(3) EPC dated 12 October 2023; it has not proposed any amendments. Your employer agrees to the text communicated under Rule 71(3) EPC and asks you to \"obtain the patent\" as soon as possible and at the lowest cost with a view to starting infringement pr oceedings in Belgium, Latvia and Malta. What actions will you take to ensure that the European patent takes effect in Belgium, Latvia and Malta? (Fee amounts need not be specified.)  3 ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To ensure that the European patent takes effect in Belgium, Latvia, and Malta, the following steps should be taken:\n\n1. **Pay the Renewal Fees**: Ensure that the renewal fees for the first year after the grant are paid. According to EPC Article 86, these fees are due in respect of the third year and each subsequent year, calculated from the date of filing of the application.\n\n2. **File National Requests for Grant**: Submit requests for grant in each of the designated countries (Belgium, Latvia, and Malta) within nine months from the date of publication of the application with the search report (in this case, 19 April 2023).\n\n3. **Respond to Communication Under Rule 71(3) EPC**: Since the examining division has issued a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC and has not proposed any amendments, your employer should review the communication carefully and confirm agreement with the text communicated. This step ensures compliance with the examination process requirements.\n\n4. **Translate the Claims**: If the application was initially filed in French, translations of the claims into the official languages of the European Patent Office (English, French, and German) must be filed according to EPC Article 14. Specifically, the claims should be translated into English and German since these are the official languages of the EPO.\n\nBy taking these actions, the European patent will be granted and will take effect in the designated countries, including Belgium, Latvia, and Malta. \n\n**Justification:**\n- **Renewal Fees**: Ensuring timely payment of renewal fees is crucial for maintaining the validity of the European patent.\n- **National Requests for Grant**: Filing national requests for grant in each designated country is necessary to enter the national phase and secure enforceability in those jurisdictions.\n- **Response to Rule 71(3) Communication**: Confirming agreement with the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC ensures compliance with the examination process.\n- **Translation of Claims**: Translating the claims into the official languages of the EPO is mandatory for the patent to be granted and enforceable across the designated states.\n\nThese steps align with the requirements outlined in the EPC Articles and guidelines provided in the context.\nContext: \nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Article 153, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a153.html\nSource: EPC Article 86, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a86.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html"

            "Question": " Your client   XYZ was granted a European patent; the language of proceedings was German. XYZ requested validation in Italy, Germany, France and the United Kingdom. During the 9 month opposition period, an opposition to the granted patent was filed, citing Article 100(a) EPC. During the opposition proceedings, a new set of claims was filed. The outcome of the opposition proceedings was that XYZ's patent was maintained in amended form. No appeal was filed by the parties. The opposition division has now issued a communication under Rule 82(2) EPC (Form 2328), setti ng a 3- month period for response.  1. What acts need to be performed in response to   the communication under Rule 82(2) EPC? 2. What are the consequences if the acts are not performed in time? In this case, what steps shall you take to maintain the patent  in amended form? 3. Let us now imagine that you have received a decision revoking the patent because the required acts were not performed in time. Is any means of redress available? 4. The patent maintained in amended form is published as EP -B2. XYZ wants  to maintain patent protection via EP -B2 in Italy, Germany, France and the UK but also wants to add patent protection in Poland. Explain how this can be achieved. ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: 1. **What acts need to be performed in response to the communication under Rule 82(2) EPC?**\n   - According to Rule 82(2) EPC, the proprietor of the patent needs to file a translation of any amended claims in the official languages of the European Patent Office other than the language of the proceedings within a period of three months.\n\n2. **What are the consequences if the acts are not performed in time? In this case, what steps shall you take to maintain the patent in amended form?**\n   - If the acts are not performed in time, the patent will be revoked according to Rule 82(3) EPC. To maintain the patent in amended form, the required acts must be performed within two months of receiving the communication about the failure to observe the time limit. Filing the translation of the amended claims in the official languages of the European Patent Office other than German would be necessary.\n\n3. **Is any means of redress available if the patent is revoked because the required acts were not performed in time?**\n   - Yes, there is a means of redress through re-establishment of rights. According to Rule 82(3) EPC, the only possibility is re-establishment of rights. This involves submitting a request for re-establishment of rights along with the necessary documentation and payment of the corresponding fees.\n\n4. **How can XYZ achieve maintaining patent protection via EP-B2 in Italy, Germany, France, and the UK while adding protection in Poland?**\n   - To maintain patent protection via EP-B2 in Italy, Germany, France, and the UK, the translation of the patent specification as maintained in amended form must be filed in Italian with the Italian Patent Office within three months of the publication of EP-B2. No further action is needed in Germany, France, and the UK since protection already exists there. For adding protection in Poland, XYZ should file a request for extension of protection to Poland before the deadline, typically six months after the publication of EP-B2. This process is governed by national law and regulations specific to each country, including the requirement to pay the necessary fees and submit the required translations.\n\n**References:**\n- Rule 82 EPC (https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html)\n- Rule 95 EPC (https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/20\nContext: \nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: EPC Rule 112, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r112.html\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: EPC Rule 92, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r92.html"

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** According to the context provided, the applicant needs to complete and file Form 1200 for entering the European phase (EP phase) and must also pay the filing fee and the search fee. Additionally, since the application entered the European phase 25 months after the filing date, which is beyond the initial 18 months plus one day, the applicant will need to pay the renewal fee for the third year as per the European Patent Convention rules.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A is incorrect because it omits the renewal fee for the third year, which becomes necessary when entering the EP phase after 18 months and 1 day.\n- Option C is incorrect because while appointing a representative might be advisable, it is not a mandatory requirement according to the provided context.\n- Option D is incorrect because there is at least one action (completing and filing Form 1200 and paying the required fees) that the applicant needs to take.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: 2022_MOCK_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

It may be paid within six months of the mentioned date of publication (Rules 39(1) , 17(3)  and 36(4) ).

These payments will only be considered valid as from the due date, provided that the amount paid corresponds to the amount payable on the due date (…)”",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: C.\n\n**Justification:** According to the provided context, particularly from the document titled \"Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.4,\" if a European patent application is deemed withdrawn under Art. 77(3), all fees, including the designation fee, will be refunded. However, the context also specifies that the designation fee must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date, and if not paid within this period, the application is deemed withdrawn under Rule 160(1).\n\nIn this specific scenario, since the search, filing, and designation fees were paid within a month of the filing date (6 February 2023), the designation fee would have been considered validly paid. Therefore, the applicant could withdraw the application at any time during the validity period of the designation fee without losing the right to a refund, assuming the application meets the criteria for deemed withdrawal under Art. 77(3).\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A (\"Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report\") is incorrect because the context indicates that the designation fee should be paid within 31 months of the filing date, not related to the publication of the search report.\n- Option B (\"Date of mention of the publication of the European search report\") is incorrect because the timing of the publication of the search report does not determine when the designation fee can be refunded; rather, it is about the timely payment of the fee itself.\n- Option D (\"Date of the start of substantive examination\") is irrelevant to the context provided, which focuses on the payment deadlines for fees and the conditions for refunding them upon deemed withdrawal.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

This aligns with option B, allowing the applicant to file a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision.\n\nOption A refers to filing a notice of appeal, which is governed by EPC Article 108. An appeal must be filed within two months of notification of the decision, making this another valid course of action for the applicant.\n\nOption C pertains to re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor, which is also covered under EPC Article 121.

The exact deadline would depend on the rules applicable to the particular case, but generally, it should be within six months from the date of receipt of the communication from the ISA, unless otherwise specified.\n\n- Option B implies that no response is necessary, which contradicts the requirement to address the ISA's findings regarding unity of invention. Applicants are expected to respond to the provisional opinion and either accept the division into separate applications or argue that unity of invention exists.\n\n- Option C mentions protesting the payment of additional search fees and paying protest fees. While protests can be filed, they do not affect the automatic withdrawal of the application if the additional search fees are not paid within the stipulated time. Therefore, this option is incorrect as it misrepresents the consequences of non-compliance.\nContext: \nSource: Case Law VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-V, 7.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_v_7_1.html\nSource: Case Law II, B.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_b_3_2.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_3_1.html"

However, the context does not specify what happens when Firm B withdraws its opposition; instead, it focuses more on the continuation of opposition proceedings upon the patent’s lapse or surrender. \n\nOption D correctly reflects a scenario where Firm B withdraws its opposition, and the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted. In such a case, Firm B would still have the right to appeal the decision according to standard EPC procedures, assuming they were not barred by withdrawing their opposition.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\nA. This statement is incorrect because it assumes Firm B retains the right to appeal after withdrawing its opposition, which is not necessarily true under EPC rules.\n\nB. This statement is incorrect because it implies Firm B can appeal after withdrawing its opposition, which contradicts the typical procedure where withdrawal usually ends the opposition proceedings.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the right to appeal to Firm C, who submitted observations rather than initiating the opposition.\n\nTherefore, Option D accurately describes a plausible scenario where Firm B withdraws its opposition but remains entitled to appeal the decision to maintain the patent as granted.\nContext: \nSource: Case Law III, Q, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_3_4.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_2_9_1.html"

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** \nAccording to the provided context, the mention of the grant of the European patent EP-X was published on 2 October 2024. For patents granted after 1 April 2018, the renewal fee for the subsequent years is no longer payable to the EPO but to the national authorities once the mention of the grant is published. Since the mention of the grant was published on 2 October 2024, the renewal fee for the fifth year should now be paid to the national authority rather than the EPO.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the renewal fee for the fifth year would have been paid to the EPO prior to the publication of the grant, which is no longer applicable post-publication.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the mention of the grant being published on 2 October 2024 indicates that the renewal fee for the sixth year would be due to the national authority, not the EPO.\n\nOption D is incorrect since the renewal fee remains due for the fifth year according to the timeline provided.\n\nTherefore, the renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year for EP-X-C0, making Option B the correct choice.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A"

E vidence of late receipt needs to be filed with the response.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B. 12 January 2025\n\n**Justification:** \n- According to Rule 126(2) EPC, if notification is made by registered letter, the letter is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day following its handover to the postal service provider. Here, the applicant received the letter on 21 September 2024, which means the letter was handed over to the postal service provider on 12 September 2024.\n\n- Adding ten days to 12 September 2024 gives us 22 September 2024, meaning the communication was effectively received by the applicant on 22 September 2024.\n\n- The communication sets a four-month time limit for reply. Starting from 22 September 2024, we need to count four months forward. \n\n- Counting four months from 22 September 2024 lands us on 22 January 2025.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: B.\n\n**Justification:** According to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 and the Unitary Patent Guide, para. 65, the translation can be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU, except English. Since the unitary effect extends to 18 states, the translation requirement should cover the official languages of these states.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n- Option A suggests translating into Dutch, but since the application is already in Dutch and the unitary effect extends beyond just the Netherlands, this is not necessarily required.\n- Option C implies translating into the official languages of all 24 EU member states, which is broader than needed and not specifically mentioned in the regulation.\n- Option D specifies Spanish, which is an official language of some EU countries but does not cover all 18 states extending the unitary effect. Therefore, it is too narrow compared to the broad requirement of the 18 states' official languages.\nContext: \nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html"

            "Question": " International application WO -X was filed at the EPO on 27 August 2024. No fees have been paid.  1. What fees are due on filing for WO -X? Fee amounts need not be mentioned. 2. What is the time limit for paying these fees? 3. What happens if these fees are not paid within the time limit, and what can you do about it?",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: 1. **What fees are due on filing for WO -X?**\n   - The fees due on filing for WO-X include the filing fee (including page fees), the search fee, and the transmittal fee.\n\n2. **What is the time limit for paying these fees?**\n   - The time limit for paying these fees is within one month of the date of receipt of the international application, which is 27 September 2024.\n\n3. **What happens if these fees are not paid within the time limit, and what can you do about it?**\n   - If the fees are not paid within the time limit, the application may be deemed withdrawn. Additionally, a late payment fee equal to 50% of the international filing fee (excluding page fees) may be imposed.\n   - To avoid the application being deemed withdrawn, the fees should be paid within the specified time frame. If the fees are not paid, the applicant can attempt to pay the outstanding fees along with the late payment fee within the extended deadline to prevent the application from being withdrawn.\n\n**Justification:**\n- The information regarding the fees due on filing and the time limit for payment comes from document 1, stating that the fees are to be paid within one month of the date of receipt of the international application, which is 27 September 2024.\n- For the consequences of non-payment and actions that can be taken, reference is made to document 1, where it states that the application may be deemed withdrawn if the fees are not paid within the time limit. Furthermore, document 3 mentions that a late payment fee of 50% of the international filing fee (without page fees) may be applied if the fees are paid later than the initial deadline.\nContext: \nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

            "Question": " On 25  October 2019, the Spanish University Isabel  II and the company Tomato Matters filed a European patent application in Spanish, accompanied by a translation into English. Tomato Matters employs more than 260 employees.  The University Isabel  II has filed two patent applications with the EPO over the past five years. On 10 October 2024, Tomato Matters transfers its rights to Naranjas Navel , a company which employs 9 members of staff and whose annual turnover is EUR  1 million. Naranjas Navel has never filed any patent applications with the EPO.  In a communication from the EPO under Rule 71(3) EPC dated 10 October 2024, the name of the applicants is given as: Isabe  III (clerical error) and Tomato Matters.  1. What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2. Let us now suppose that the request for unitary effect has been refused. What is the time limit for lodging  an application to reverse this  decision, and to whom should the application be addressed? ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: ### 1. Steps to Obtain a Unitary Patent\n\nTo obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel II and Naranjas Navel, the following steps are necessary:\n\n- **Step 1: Correct the Name of the Applicants**\n  - File a request for correction of the name of the applicants with the EPO. This would involve correcting the name of the applicant from \"Isabe  III\" to \"Isabel II\" and changing the applicant from Tomato Matters to Naranjas Navel.\n\n- **Step 2: Transfer Application Rights**\n  - File a request to transfer the application rights from Tomato Matters to Naranjas Navel. This involves paying an administrative fee (which is free if requested through MyEPO Portfolio).\n\n- **Step 3: Submit a Request for Unitary Effect**\n  - File a request for unitary effect with the EPO no later than one month after the mention of the European patent's grant is published in the European Patent Bulletin. This step is crucial for obtaining unitary patent protection across all participating member states.\n\n- **Step 4: Pay Reduced Fees**\n  - Pay the reduced sixth renewal fee, the reduced fee for grant and printing, and the filing of translations of the claims in German and French.\n\n- **Step 5: Filing Translations**\n  - Ensure that the translations of the claims in German and French are filed with the EPO.\n\n- **Step 6: Pay Administrative Fees for Unitary Effect**\n  - Pay the administrative fee for filing the request for unitary effect (if not already included in the previous step).\n\n#### Compensation Scheme\nNaranjas Navel does not qualify for compensation for translation costs since it is not considered a Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME). Therefore, they cannot benefit from the compensation scheme for translation costs.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- **Correcting the Name of the Applicants**: According to the guidelines, the EPO will check compliance with the requirement to file translations. If the translation has not been filed, the application could be deemed withdrawn. Hence, correcting the name of the applicants is essential.\n- **Transfer of Application Rights**: Tomato Matters needs to transfer its rights to Naranjas Navel, which incurs an administrative fee but is free via MyEPO Portfolio.\n- **Request for Unitary Effect**: The request must be filed within one month of the publication of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin to avoid delays.\n- **\nContext: \nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: EPC Rule 157, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r157.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2_1.html"

            "Question": " In March 2018, a European patent application was filed in French. A European patent was granted in June 2023. Unitary effect has been registered and the proprietor has filed a statement concerning licences of right. The patent has also been validated in Sp ain and in Croatia; the European patent is still in force in these states.  The proprietor filed a request for limitation of the patent. The examining division has issued an interlocutory decision, indicating that the patent with amended claims and an amended description meets the requirements of the EPC. The mention of the limita tion will be published in the last European Patent Bulletin of 2024.  1. To maintain the existing patents, what translations must be filed, at which offices? 2. Do any fees have to be paid? Fee amounts need not be mentioned. ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the questions:\n\n### 1. Translations Required\n\n- **Spain**: According to **Article 65 EPC**, Spain can require the proprietor to supply a translation of the European patent in one of its official languages. Since the European patent bulletin mentions the limitation, the proprietor must file a Spanish translation of the patent within three months of the publication of the bulletin in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\n- **Croatia**: Similarly, under **Article 65 EPC**, Croatia can also require the proprietor to supply a translation of the European patent in one of its official languages. Therefore, the proprietor must file a Croatian translation of the patent within three months of the publication of the bulletin in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\n- **Other Offices**: For Germany, France, and Italy, no action is required according to the context provided, as they are already official languages of the European Patent Office. No additional translations are needed for these countries.\n\n### 2. Fees to Be Paid\n\n- **Translation Fee**: There is no explicit mention of a fee for translating the patent into the official languages of Spain and Croatia. However, **Article 65 EPC** allows these states to prescribe that the proprietor must pay all or part of the costs of publication of such translations. Thus, while there is no stated fee amount, the proprietor might be required to pay some or all of the costs associated with the translation and publication in Spain and Croatia.\n\n- **Surcharge for Late Performance**: According to **Rule 95(3) EPC** and **Rule 82(3) EPC**, if the proprietor fails to perform certain acts within the stipulated time limits, a surcharge for late performance must be paid. This applies here since the interlocutory decision indicates amendments to the patent, and the proprietor needs to ensure compliance with the time limits set forth in the EPC rules.\n\nIn summary:\n\n**The correct answer is:**\n- **Translations**: File a Spanish translation in Spain and a Croatian translation in Croatia within three months of the publication of the bulletin in the European Patent Bulletin.\n- **Fees**: Pay a surcharge for late performance of the acts required to maintain the European patent in amended form, and potentially cover the costs of translation and publication in Spain and Croatia, depending on local regulations.\nContext: \nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: EPC Article 86, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a86.html\nSource: EPC Article 65, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a65.html\nSource: EPC Rule 92, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r92.html"

            "Question": " European application EP1 was filed online on 2  September 2024 without claiming priority. You realise today, 10  October 2024, that priority from CN1 filed in Chinese on 31  August 2023 was not claimed.  1. Explain why it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 and what steps must be taken.  2. On the same day, you realise that, despite all due care, you filed the description of another application, instead of the priority application translated into English. It was intended that EP1 should have the same content as CN1.  How can you correct this? What will be the effect on the filing date?  3. What is the consequence with regard to claiming priority from CN1? What action could be taken? ",
            "Answer": "",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: ### 1. Explanation and Steps to Claim Priority from CN1\n\n**Explanation:**\nIt is still possible to claim priority from CN1 because the deadline for filing a declaration of priority extends until 2 January 2025, which is beyond the current date of 10 October 2024.\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n- File a declaration of priority indicating:\n  - The date of the previous application (CN1, 31 August 2023)\n  - The state or WTO member in or for which it was filed (China)\n  - The application number of CN1\n- Pay the corresponding fees associated with the declaration of priority.\n\n**Sources Used:**\n- Content:1 (EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1, allowing for priority claim)\n\n### 2. Correcting the Description Error and Effect on Filing Date\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo correct the error of filing the wrong description, you need to file a corrected version of the description within two months of filing (Rule 56a EPC).\n\n**Steps to Take:**\n- File the correct description of CN1 within the next two months (by 4 November 2024, extended to 4 November 2024).\n- Ensure that the corrected description accurately reflects the content of CN1.\n\n**Effect on Filing Date:**\nThe filing date of EP1 remains unchanged at 2 September 2024. However, the corrected description will ensure that the application complies with the requirements regarding the content of the application.\n\n**Sources Used:**\n- Content:1 (The applicant may file the correct description within two months of filing)\n\n### 3. Consequences and Action Regarding Claiming Priority from CN1\n\n**Consequence:**\nClaiming priority from CN1 would extend the filing date of EP1 to 31 August 2023, the filing date of CN1.\n\n**Action to Take:**\n- File the declaration of priority as described above.\n- Ensure that the corrected description aligns with the content of CN1.\n\n**Sources Used:**\n- Content:1 (EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1, allowing for priority claim)\n- Content:1 (An applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating the necessary details)\nContext: \nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2022_MOCK_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_4_1.html"

            "Question": " Inventor Mr Tulip, a Dutch national, filed Dutch national patent application NL- 1, which comprises 50 pages and includes 20 claims, all in the Dutch language. The EPO established a search report at the request of the Netherlands Patent Office. Mr Tulip then filed an international patent application WO -1, claiming the priority of, and with the same content (description and claims in Dutch) as, NL- 1.  The international publication of WO -1, with the international search report, comprises 45 pages, including 1 page of bibliographic data. The EPO acted as International Searching Authority. International preliminary examination was requested in time; however, no amendments were made in the international phase. 30 months have elapsed since the date of filing of NL- 1.  Mr Tulip now asks for an indication of the cost of entry into the European phase, i.e. how much he will have to pay in official fees over the next 8 months, if all formal requirements are met but expenses kept to a minimum. This will be his first applicati on with the EPO. Mr Tulip expressly requests that no amendments be made before substantive examination. Please name the fees that need to be paid and state which reductions are available. It is sufficient to indicate how to calculate, but it is not necessary to indicate the amounts nor to provide full calculations. 6.
