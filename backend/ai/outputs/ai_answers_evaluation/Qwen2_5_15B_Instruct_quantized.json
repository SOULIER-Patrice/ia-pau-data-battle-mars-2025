In other proceedings, a request for extension, even if filed without reasons, is normally allowed if it is for not more than two months and the total period set does not thereby exceed six months. A request for a longer extension, especially if the total period set exceeds six months, is allowed only exceptionally, when the reasons given are sufficient to show convincingly that a reply in the period previously set will not be possible.

This applies even if reference is made to these sequences in one or more claims or if the sequences are essential features of the invention or necessary for the prior-art search (seeJ 8/11). If the European patent application discloses nucleotide or amino acid sequences that are fragments or variants of a prior-art sequence, a sequence listing complying with the applicable WIPO standard has to be filed for these sequence fragments or variants (see the notice from the EPO dated 9 December 2021,OJ EPO 2021, A97, p. 7).

If such insufficiently disclosed sequences are not essential features of the claimed invention, normally no objection is raised. On the other hand, where these sequences are essential features of at least a part of the claimed subject-matter, this results in problems relating to the sufficiency of the original disclosure according toArt. 83, because the nature of the sequences cannot be unambiguously derived from the incomplete or ambiguous reference to the database \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-II, 6.1\n\nContent: Legal basis Rule 30(3) EPC Where the applicant has not filed a sequence listing complying with the requirements under  paragraph  1 at the date of filing, the European Patent Office shall invite the applicant to furnish such a sequence listing and pay the late furnishing fee .

Requests for such corrections may be made at any time, provided that proceedings are pending before the EPO (seeJ 42/92). However, if the error to be corrected concerns items that third parties might expect to be able to take at face value and whose correction would jeopardise their rights, the request for correction must be filed as soon as possible, and at least in time for incorporation in the publication of the European patent application. With regard to correction of priority claims, specific provisions apply with a view to protecting the interests of third parties and allow the applicant to correct priority claims and lay down a time limit for doing so (seeRule 52(3)andA‑III, 6.5.2). This ensures that corrected priority information is available when the application is published. The applicant can only correct the priority claim after this date, in particular after publication of the application, under certain limited circumstances where it is apparent on the face of the published application that a mistake has been made. SeeJ 2/92,J 3/91andJ 6/91as well asJ 11/92andJ 7/94.

Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n2. **Option B**: Antonia can validly file PCT-A with the EPO.\n   - PCT-A is specifically related to filing an international patent application under the PCT system. According to the guidelines, an international patent application can be filed in any language. However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French, or German), a translation must be filed within two months of the date of filing. Given that Antonia is from Argentina and has Argentinean nationality, she might face additional legal requirements or restrictions depending on the specific country laws governing applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority under Art. 75(1)(b).\n\n3. **Option C**: Antonia can validly file EP-A with the EPO.\n   - EP-A refers to a European patent application. According to the guidelines, European patent applications can be filed in any language. There are no specific requirements or restrictions mentioned for filing a European patent application in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French, or German). Thus, this option appears to be correct.\n\n4. **Option D**: None of the above.\n   - Based on our analysis, Option B seems to be the most accurate representation of the situation since PCT-A does involve filing an international patent application, which follows different rules compared to a European patent application.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct statement about Antonia's ability to file her applications with the EPO is:\n\n**None of the above**\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: Legal basis G 4/08 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal If an international patent application has been filed and published under the PCT  in an official language of the EPO, it is not possible, on entry into the European phase, to file a translation of the application  into another EPO  official language .

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To determine the last day for filing a demand for international preliminary examination, we need to consider the rules set out in the EPC Rule 70.\n\nAccording to Rule 70, the applicant may request examination of the European patent application up to six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. The European search report was transmitted on 10 June 2022, and the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report on 10 July 2022.\n\nTherefore, the deadline for requesting examination is:\n\n10 July 2022 + 6 months = 10 January 2023\n\nHowever, there is another rule that specifies when the applicant should file a demand for examination. According to footnote Ref102, the applicant may request examination of the European patent application up to six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. This means that the applicant should file the demand for examination within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.\n\nSince the European search report was transmitted on 10 June 2022, the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report is 10 July 2022. Therefore, the applicant should file the demand for examination within six months of 10 July 2022, which is:\n\n10 July 2022 + 6 months = 10 January 2023\n\nThis date falls outside the range of the deadlines mentioned in the options provided. However, since the question asks about the last day for filing a demand for international preliminary examination, and considering the rules set out in the EPC Rule 70, the correct answer is:\n\n**The last day for filing a demand for international preliminary examination is not listed in the options provided.**\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: **None of the options provided is correct.**\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: Q4-1 PCT Direct procedure (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1-3).Q4-2 The EPO has to be used as International Searching Authority (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1) because PCT Direct is a service offered by the EPO.

(Rule 26bis.1(a)) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. 16 months from 10 July 2021 (earlier of 2 priority dates) = 10 November 2022 4 months from 3 June 2022 = 3 October 2022 The answer is therefore 10 November 2022, as it is later than 3 October 2022. Q4-5 7 August 2023. (Rule 54bis.1(a)): 22 months from priority date or 3 months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and of the written opinion established under R. 43bis.1, whichever period expires later. 7 October 2021 + 22 months = 7 August 2023. Receipt of the international search report on 1 September 2022 + 3 months = 1 December 2022, which is earlier.

Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) together with the confirmation. Within two months of the original filing date 5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 6 February. (b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together with the confirmation). RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 2023 (c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. (d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of technical preparations for the publication.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To determine the correct statement regarding the requirement for a power of attorney, let's analyze each action:\n\nI. Withdrawing an international patent application at the European Patent Office as the receiving office.\nII. Filing a demand for international preliminary examination for an international patent application at the European Patent Office as the International Preliminary Examining Authority.\n\nFrom the rules provided, we know that:\n\n- A separate power of attorney should be submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau when appointing an agent.\n- However, if the power of attorney appoints an agent under Rule 90.1(b), (b-bis), (c) or (d)(ii), it should be submitted to the International Searching Authority, the Authority specified for supplementary search or the International Preliminary Examining Authority, as the case may be.\n\nLet's evaluate each action:\n\nI. Withdrawing an international patent application at the European Patent Office as the receiving office:\n- This action involves withdrawing an application, which typically occurs after the application has already been filed.\n- According to rule 90.5, a separate power of attorney should be submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau, regardless of how the agent was appointed.\n- Therefore, a power of attorney signed by each applicant is generally required for this action.\n\nII. Filing a demand for international preliminary examination for an international patent application at the European Patent Office as the International Preliminary Examining Authority:\n- This action involves submitting a demand for international preliminary examination, which is part of the initial process of applying for a patent.\n- According to rule 90.5, a separate power of attorney should be submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau, regardless of how the agent was appointed.\n- Therefore, a power of attorney signed by each applicant is generally required for this action as well.\n\nGiven these analyses, both actions require a power of attorney signed by each applicant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. For both I and II the requirement to submit a power of attorney signed by each applicant may be waived.\n\nFinal answer: D.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: .

Receiving office can be any office open to a German applicant (OJ EPO 2017, A21): DPMA, IB, EPO. Q4-3 Taiwan is not a PCT contracting state (PCT Applicant's Guide ‒ International Phase – Annex A). The solution is to file national patent application in Taiwan within the priority year, claiming priority of the European patent application. Q4-4. 10 November 2022. (Rule 26bis.1(a)) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. 16 months from 10 July 2021 (earlier of 2 priority dates) = 10 November 2022 4 months from 3 June 2022 = 3 October 2022 The answer is therefore 10 November 2022, as it is later than 3 October 2022.

The automatic debiting procedure may be used for effecting payment of the fees falling due on filing the request (see Annex A.1 and Annex A.2 to the ADA,Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2022). However, automatic debiting can only be performed if the EPO can establish whether or not a page fee needs to be included as part of the filing fee (seeA‑III, 13.2). This is only possible if the EPO has access to the documents referred to inArt. 20 PCT, i.e. if: –the international application has already been published at the time the request for early processing is received, –the EPO is the receiving Office, or –the EPO is acting as (S)ISA or IPEA. If none of the above documents is available to the EPO on the day the request for early processing is filed, applicants are advised to choose another means of payment. Otherwise the fees due will be debited on the date of receipt of the documents referred to inArt. 20 PCTfrom the International Bureau (Rule 47.4 PCT) and the date on which the request for early processing takes effect will be postponed to that date. If pursuant toRule 159(1)(h)a certificate of exhibition must be filed and this requirement is not met, this will not prevent the request for early processing from being effective, but it will affect the prior art that the EPO takes into account in the European phase.

The contents of the specification are transferred to the Implementing Regulations (seeR. 73(1) EPC).Art. 98 EPCnow contains the words \"as soon as possible\" in order to indicate that it is not always technically possible to publish the specification on the same day as the mention of the grant. InT 84/16the board referred toT 1644/10and held that no legal effects were provided by the EPC with respect to the patent specification. The board endorsed the finding in Legal Advice No. 17/90 (OJ 1990, 260) that \"the text of the patent specification (...) has no binding character. Its function is confined to facilitating public access to the content of the granted patent, particularly the nature and scope of the industrial property right\". InJ 7/96(OJ 1999, 443) the Legal Board did not share the view of the department of first instance and the applicant that the proceedings for grant were concluded on the date the examining division reaches its decision to grant a European patent underArt. 97(2) EPC 1973. The Legal Board noted that it was true that this date represented the date on which the process of reaching a decision on the application within the examining division was concluded; both the EPO and the applicant were bound by the decision as far as the text of the patent to be granted, the claims, description and drawings were concerned, and the subject-matter of the text of the patent became res judicata at that date. Thereafter, the EPO could no longer amend its decision and had to disregard any fresh matter the parties might submit (seeG 12/91,OJ 1994, 285). Only linguistic errors, errors of transcription and obvious mistakes could be corrected later underR. 89 EPC 1973.

A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. Alternatively, underRule 53(3), a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within that same time limit. This declaration must be unambiguous, stating that the translation is \"complete\" or, for example, \"identical\" or \"literal\". Declarations in diluted or modified form (stating, for example, that the translation is \"practically complete\" or that the contents \"are essentially the same\") cannot be accepted. The same applies to cases where the declaration is obviously incorrect (e.g. if several priorities are claimed for a single European application or if the European application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed). In all these cases a complete translation must be filed. Where the European application contains claims on its date of filing and the priority application did not contain claims on its filing date or contained fewer claims on its filing date than the subsequent European application, the declaration cannot be accepted.

Content: 3. Transfer of the European patent application A European patent application may be transferred for one or more of the designated contracting states. A European patent application may be transferred for one or more of the designated contracting states. Art. 71 Art. 72is an autonomous provision which exclusively governs the formal requirements of such transfers. The EPO registers a transfer of rights in respect of a pending European patent application (seeA‑IV, 1.1.1andJ 10/93) in the European Patent Register on request, upon fulfilment of the prerequisites ofRule 22. The request is not deemed to have been filed until an administrative fee has been paid. The amount of the fee is determined by the latest schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (seeepo.org). Where the request relates to multiple applications, a separate fee has to be paid for each application. With effect from the entry into force of amendedRule 22(1)on 1 April 2024, the conditions under which payment of an administrative fee is due is laid down by the President of the EPO. Rule 22furthermore requires the production of documents providing evidence of such a transfer. Any kind of written evidence suitable for proving the transfer is admissible. This includes formal documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (the original or a copy thereof) or other official documents or extracts thereof, provided that they immediately verify the transfer (J 12/00).Art. 72requires that, for an assignment, the signatures of the parties appear on the documents submitted as evidence of the transfer. Assignment documents filed electronically (seeA‑II, 1.1.1A‑II, 1.2.2) may, instead of handwritten signatures, bear qualified electronic signatures (see notice from the EPO dated 22 October 2021;OJ EPO 2021, A86) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIV, 3\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14. Content: 14. Translation of the application There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: (i)the European patent application was filed according toArt. 14(2)in a non‑EPO language (ii)the European patent application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in a non‑EPO language (Rule 40(3)) (iii)the European divisional application was filed in the same language as the earlier (parent) application on which it is based, where this was not an official EPO language (Rule 36(2)– seeA‑IV, 1.3.3). In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according toRule 6(1)(for type (i)) orRule 40(3)(for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according toRule 36(2). Art. 14(2)Rule 6(1) The EPO will check compliance with this requirement. If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency underRule 58within two months in accordance with the procedure explained inA‑III, 16. Art. 90(3)Rule 57(a) Failure to file the translation on time in response to the invitation underRule 58results in the application being deemed withdrawn according toArt. 14(2). The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1). Further processing is ruled out byRule 135(2)for the above time limits for supplying the translation underRule 40(3),Rule 6(1)andRule 36(2)and for the time limit for rectifying the failure to file the translation underRule 58 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.3.

Despite all due care being taken by applicant B, international application PCT-B claiming priority from US-B was only filed on 7 June 2021.

As set out hereafter, if the applicant has already filed a request for restoration of priority with the receiving Office, a (new) request need not always be filed upon entry into the European phase. If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the \"due care criterion\", no new request need be filed with the EPO as designated/elected Office, since the EPO will, in principle, recognise the decision of the receiving Office. If, however, the EPO has reasonable doubt that the requirements for grant were met, it will notify the applicant accordingly. In this communication the reasons for such doubt will be indicated and a time limit will be set within which the applicant may submit comments. Consequently, if the applicant wants the priority claim to be valid in the procedure before the EPO as designated/elected Office, a request for restoration must always be filed if, in the procedure before the receiving Office: –no request for restoration of priority right was filed; –a request for restoration of priority right was rejected; –a request for restoration of priority right was granted under the \"unintentional criterion\". The EPO as designated/elected Office will grant a request for restoration of priority right only if the following requirements are met: (i)the filing date is within two months of the date of expiry of the priority period; (ii)the failure to claim the right of priority within the priority period occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been taken; (iii)a request for restoration of priority is filed within one month from the date on which the 31-month time limit for entry into the European phase expired or from the effective date of early entry into the European phase (seeE‑IX, 2.8); where the application is deemed withdrawn underRule 160(1)for failure to comply with a requirement underRule 159(1), the request for restoration of priority may still be filed together with a timely request for further processing in respect of the 31-month time limit underRule 159(1)or, failing this, with a timely request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the period for requesting further processing; (iv)the fee for restoration of priority (Art \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.3\n\nContent: Q4-1 PCT Direct procedure (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1-3).Q4-2 The EPO has to be used as International Searching Authority (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1) because PCT Direct is a service offered by the EPO. Receiving office can be any office open to a German applicant (OJ EPO 2017, A21): DPMA, IB, EPO. Q4-3 Taiwan is not a PCT contracting state (PCT Applicant's Guide ‒ International Phase – Annex A). The solution is to file national patent application in Taiwan within the priority year, claiming priority of the European patent application. Q4-4. 10 November 2022. (Rule 26bis.1(a)) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. 16 months from 10 July 2021 (earlier of 2 priority dates) = 10 November 2022 4 months from 3 June 2022 = 3 October 2022 The answer is therefore 10 November 2022, as it is later than 3 October 2022. Q4-5 7 August 2023. (Rule 54bis.1(a)): 22 months from priority date or 3 months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and of the written opinion established under R. 43bis.1, whichever period expires later. 7 October 2021 + 22 months = 7 August 2023.

Where the file number or the copy of the previous application has not yet been submitted at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, the EPO invites the applicant to furnish the number or the copy within two months. However,Rule 53(2)and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 18 October 2018,OJ EPO 2018, A78, providing an exception to the requirement that a copy of the previous application be furnished (seeA‑III, 6.7), also apply to international applications entering the European phase. Furthermore, where the applicant has complied withRule 17.1(a)PCT,Rule 17.1(b)PCTorRule 17.1(b-bis) PCTthe EPO as a designated Office may not ask the applicant himself to furnish it with a copy of the priority document (Rule 17.2(a) PCT, second sentence). If the priority document is not on file, substantive examination may nevertheless be started, provided that neither intermediate documents (published in the priority period) norArt. 54(3)documents exist which cause the patentability of the subject-matter claimed to depend on the validity of the priority right. However, no European patent may be granted until such time as the priority document is on file. In such a case, the applicant is informed that the decision to grant will not be taken as long as the priority document is missing. On the other hand, the application may be refused without the priority document being on file, provided that the relevant prior art is neither an intermediate document nor anArt. 54(3)document, the relevance of which depends on the validity of the priority right. For more details on treatment of such cases in examination seeF‑VI, 3.4 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1\n\nContent: . 153(2),Art. 11(3) PCT). If applicants wish not only the processing of the application before the EPO as designated/elected Office but also the examination of the application to start, they must have filed a valid request for examination (including payment of the examination fee), even if the time limit underRule 70(1)has not yet expired at the date of effective entry into the European phase, since examination will be taken up only if a request for examination has been validly filed (seeE‑IX, 2.5.2). Furthermore, if a request for examination is filed before the EPO has, where applicable, sent the supplementary European search report to the applicants, examination will start only upon receipt of an indication from them that they wish to proceed further with the application and, if required, a response to the extended European search report (seeE‑IX, 2.5.3). Rule 159(1) For international applications filed between 1 July 2020 and 31 October 2022, correction of erroneously filed elements or parts underRule 20.5bis(d) PCTby the receiving Office is not effective in proceedings before the EPO as designated/elected Office in accordance with the EPO's declaration of incompatibility (Rule 20.8 PCT). Thus, applicants who want to make use of the abridged procedure (by requesting that the correct application documents be disregarded or by indicating that they wish to pursue the application containing the correct application documents with the date of receipt of those application documents as the filing date – seeC‑III, 1.3) must inform the EPO accordingly at the time the request for early processing is validly filed or at the latest before the communication underRules 20.8(c)PCTandRules82ter.1(c)PCTandRules 82ter.1(d) PCTis issued. The automatic debiting procedure may be used for effecting payment of the fees falling due on filing the request (see Annex A.1 and Annex A \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8\n\n"

CoffeeBreak then asked you to file an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application and with no amendments compared to that application. The priority application contains drawings that are essential for understanding the invention.  On 5 December 2022, you filed an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application at the International Bureau, using PCT/RO/101. Your colleague handling a patent application for shoe soles left by mistake his drawings in your filing folder. Therefore, you filed the wrong drawings with the international patent application claiming the coffee maker instead of the correct drawings.  a. You discover your mistake today, 12 December 2022. Assuming that the International Bureau does not detect the wrong drawings, what actions can you take of your own volition to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. b. You do not discover your mistake until receiving a PCT/RO/107 notification dated 4 January 2023 from the International Bureau. What actions can you take to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. c. What would be your answer to previous questions (a) and (b) if, at your client's request, you had not claimed priority of the European patent application? Please give reasons for your answer.

Instead, there arose a legal fiction that the priority period had been observed, even though the filing date was actually later than that period's expiry date. InT 382/94(OJ 1998, 24) the board held that if the drawings were filed in full on the date of filing, they formed part of the application as filed, even if they contained text matter in an official language other than the language of the proceedings. There was nothing to prevent the application being amended on the basis of a translation of this text matter into the language of the proceedings. The language requirements for a European patent application were amended under the EPC 2000, see chapterIII.F.1. \"Language of filing and date of filing of a European patent application\". InJ 1/12the appellant had filed a European patent application with the UK Patent Office with the same documents as those underlying the later application before the EPO. The application in the UK never reached the EPO. The Legal Board therefore had to consider whether, contrary toArt. 80 EPC 1973, it was justified to assign the application the earlier filing date (Art. 75(1)(b) EPC 1973).Art. 77(2) EPC 1973provides that European patent applications filed within the member states are to be forwarded to the EPO within six weeks after filing.Art. 77(5) EPC 1973supplements this provision by providing that European patent applications which do not reach the EPO before the specified time limit are deemed to be withdrawn. It followed that the application filed with the UK Patent Office was deemed to have been withdrawn. No re-establishment of rights is provided for.

            "Question": "  On 10 December 2021, your client, a large Romanian company, filed a Romanian national patent application RO-H. RO-H is drafted in Romanian and comprises 32 pages of description and drawings, and four pages with 15 claims. Your client has informed you that they will prepare and forward an English translation of RO-H in due course. This will comprise 29 pages of description and drawings, four pages with 15 claims and an abstract comprising two pages. Your client wants you to file today, 12 December 2022, a European patent application EP-H drafted in Romanian and claiming priority of RO-H.  a. What fees have to be paid and what would be the last date for paying them? b. You filed an automatic debit order for EP-H. On the decisive payment date, you receive an email from the EPO informing you that there are insufficient funds in your deposit account to cover any of the fees to be paid (as identified in your answer to question (a)). You replenish the account two days after receiving the email. Do you have to take any further action to ensure these fees are paid? c. What is the time limit for filing an English translation of the application via the EPO's online services? What is the consequence for the time limit if, on the last day of the period for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services which prevents you from filing it? The outage lasts for the whole of that day. ",
            "Answer": "(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD).

Translation of the application There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: (i)the European patent application was filed according toArt. 14(2)in a non‑EPO language (ii)the European patent application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in a non‑EPO language (Rule 40(3)) (iii)the European divisional application was filed in the same language as the earlier (parent) application on which it is based, where this was not an official EPO language (Rule 36(2)– seeA‑IV, 1.3.3). In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according toRule 6(1)(for type (i)) orRule 40(3)(for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according toRule 36(2).

Content: 3.4 Translation of the previous application A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. Alternatively, underRule 53(3), a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within that same time limit. This declaration must be unambiguous, stating that the translation is \"complete\" or, for example, \"identical\" or \"literal\". Declarations in diluted or modified form (stating, for example, that the translation is \"practically complete\" or that the contents \"are essentially the same\") cannot be accepted. The same applies to cases where the declaration is obviously incorrect (e.g. if several priorities are claimed for a single European application or if the European application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed). In all these cases a complete translation must be filed. Where the European application contains claims on its date of filing and the priority application did not contain claims on its filing date or contained fewer claims on its filing date than the subsequent European application, the declaration cannot be accepted. A merely different arrangement of the various elements of the application (e.g \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4\n\nContent: (a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) together with the confirmation. Within two months of the original filing date 5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 6 February. (b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together with the confirmation). RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 2023 (c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. (d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of technical preparations for the publication. Publication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, which is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June).

            "Question": "  Applicant A filed European patent application EP-A1 in English in May 2019. It describes two different inventions, X and Y, and claims invention X only. The European search report was drawn up for invention X only. A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting a time limit of four months for response was issued by the EPO on 16 May 2022. A two-month extension of this time limit was granted on 26 September 2022. As of today’s date, no response has been filed. Applicant A is now interested in invention Y. Today, 12 December 2022, he files a European divisional application EP-A2 based on EP-A1 and describing invention Y. No fees were paid, and no claims were submitted at the time of filing.  What does applicant A have to do to have invention Y searched by the EPO?",
            "Answer": "A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending. Currently, EP-A1 is deemed to be withdrawn because no response to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC was filed. The time limit for filing a response expired on 28 November 2022 (26 Saturday > Monday 28). In order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request further processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC. The filing fee and search fee for EP-A2 are due on filing. They may be paid within one month of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 36(3) EPC). The third renewal fee and the fourth renewal fee for the divisional become due on filing. They can be validly paid without surcharge within four months of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 51(3) EPC) (otherwise with surcharge within six months of the same date). The applicant should file claims directed to invention Y (Rule 40(1) EPC) in response to a communication from the EPO (under Rule 58 EPC setting a time limit of two months from the date of receipt to supply claims) at the latest.",

This period is deemed to have been observed if the information is communicated before completion of the technical preparations for the publication of the patent application. R. 21(1) EPC(R. 19(1) EPC 1973) requires consent to the rectification of a designation of inventor to be given by a \"wrongly designated\" person. InJ 8/82(OJ 1984, 155), the Legal Board of Appeal held that a person already named whose name is not to be cancelled from the designation is not a \"wrongly designated\" person within the meaning of the Rule and his consent to the addition of the name of another person is not required \nSource: Case Law IV, A.6.2\n\nContent: . 99(1) EPCdid not prevent inventors from filing an opposition. The board held the patent proprietor and the opposing inventor to be different persons. The inventor, although a shareholder in the patent proprietor, was not an executive of the company, nor did he have any substantial influence on commercial and judicial decisions concerning the business of the patent proprietor. A procedure for limitation or revocation of a European patent at the request of the patent proprietor is now provided for underArt. 105ato105c EPC(see also chapterIV.D.1.). \nSource: Case Law IV, C.2.1.3\n\n"

The Legal Board pointed out that the EPO as elected or designated Office was fully competent to interpret applications appointing it to act in these capacities. It was not bound by the interpretation of the receiving Office or of the International Bureau (see alsoJ 26/87,J 17/99). InJ 3/94the Legal Board could not agree with the applicant's contention that the election of two EPC contracting states made the EPO an elected Office by operation of law. In the PCT request, the applicant had designated a European patent under \"Regional Patent\" and five PCT contracting states, including Germany and the United Kingdom, under \"National Patent\". However, in the demand for international preliminary examination, filed with the EPO as IPEA, only the five PCT contracting states were elected; under \"Regional Patent\" there was no cross indicating the European patent. The Legal Board held that the EPO did not become an elected Office in this case. One of the principles implemented byArt. 31(4)(a) PCTwas that applicants could choose the office for which they intended to use the results of the international preliminary examination. Furthermore, it was not only a matter for the EPC to decide whether an election made for the national route was also valid for the EPO. The validity of an election had to be decided during the international phase in order to give effect to the election and, in particular, to the IPEA's duty of confidentiality (Art. 38 PCT). As to whether the EPO had competence to interpret a declaration in the demand differently from the IPEA, the Legal Board inJ 4/94observed that the interpretation of the demand was at the outset the task of the IPEA. However, this did not necessarily exclude an office alleged to be an elected Office from interpreting the demand as well. In the case in hand, there had been a formal deficiency in the demand (two EPC contracting states had been indicated as elected Offices in handwriting, next to the ''EP'' box).

This means that the applicant needs to file the application in a language other than English, French, or German. Option B describes a situation where both parties involved (the German firm and the natural person) are residents of Germany and employ employees, thus meeting the criterion of filing in an admissible non-EPO language. Therefore, the applicant would qualify for the reduction of the filing fee.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: Title: EPC Rule 7a.

European patent application Under the EPC 1973, an application could be filed in an official EPO language (Art. 14(1) EPC 1973) or, by persons benefiting from the \"language privilege\", in an official language of a contracting state other than English, French or German (Art. 14(2) EPC 1973). Under the EPC 1973, an application could be filed in an official EPO language (Art. 14(1) EPC 1973) or, by persons benefiting from the \"language privilege\", in an official language of a contracting state other than English, French or German (Art. 14(2) EPC 1973). According toJ 4/88(OJ 1989, 483, see headnote), for the purposes ofArt. 14(2) EPC 1973andR. 6(3) EPC 1973it was sufficient if the description and claims were filed in an official language of a contracting state other than English, French or German; it was not significant for this purpose that other parts of the European patent application were filed in one of the official languages of the EPO only (further toJ 7/80,OJ 1981, 137– see in this chapterIII.F.1.). If the applicant availed himself of the option provided inArt. 14(2) EPC 1973both the filing fee and the examination fee were reduced (R. 6(3) EPC 1973). \nSource: Case Law III, F.6.1\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1. Content: 9.2.1 Conditions European patent applications can be filed in any language. If filed in a language other than an official EPO language, a translation must be furnished. Consequently, the languages that can be used for filing European patent applications fall into three categories: European patent applications can be filed in any language. If filed in a language other than an official EPO language, a translation must be furnished. Consequently, the languages that can be used for filing European patent applications fall into three categories: (a)official EPO languages (b)official languages of contracting states other than English, French or German, such as Dutch, Italian or Spanish (\"admissible non‑EPO languages\") (c)all other languages, such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean. Art. 14(2) Furthermore, documents that have to be filed within a time limit may also be filed in an admissible non‑EPO language if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is within the territory of a contracting state having the language in question as an official language or if the applicant is a national of such a contracting state (seeA‑VII, 1.1andA-VII,1.2). Art. 14(4) In the case of European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2014and international applications entering the European phase on or after that date,a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants is provided for. For international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2014, a 30% reduction of the examination fee is provided for(see the notice from the EPO dated 10 January 2014,OJ EPO 2014, A23). In this regard, it is necessary to file the documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non‑EPO language, and to file the translation not earlier than simultaneously (seeG 6/91).

However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French and German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing (Rule 6(1)). Although filing in any language is in principle possible, there may be limitations due to the applicable national law for applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority underArt. 75(1)(b). European patent applications can be filed in any language. However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French and German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing (Rule 6(1)). Although filing in any language is in principle possible, there may be limitations due to the applicable national law for applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority underArt. 75(1)(b). Art. 14(1)andArt. 14(2)Rule 6(1) In the case of applications filed in \"an admissible non‑EPO language\" (seeA‑VII, 3.2), a reduction of the filing fee is allowed for certain categories of applicants (seeA‑X, 9.2.1andA‑X, 9.2.2). Filing a European patent application in a single language is not a requirement for according a filing date (Art. 90(3)in conjunction withArt. 14(2)).

Mr Van Holland can remedy the deficiency by filing an English translation of EP -div within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC.\n\nThis is because the Receiving Section has issued a notice of loss of rights, indicating that the application is deemed withdrawn without further action.

If a required translation is not filed in due time (seeR. 6(1)EPC,R.36(2)EPC,R.40(3)EPC,R.57(a)EPC,R.58 EPC), the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn (Art. 14(2) EPC; cf.Art. 90(3) EPC 1973andJ 18/01). Under the former law, a European patent application could only be filed in an official EPO language (Art. 14(1) EPC 1973) or, by persons benefiting from the \"language privilege\", in an official language of a contracting state other than English, French or German (\"admissible non‑EPO language\"), with a translation to be filed in an official EPO language (Art. 14(2) EPC 1973; see alsoJ 15/98,OJ 2001, 183;J 6/05andJ 9/01).

In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according toRule 6(1)(for type (i)) orRule 40(3)(for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according toRule 36(2).

Content: 3.4 Translation of the previous application A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. Alternatively, underRule 53(3), a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within that same time limit. This declaration must be unambiguous, stating that the translation is \"complete\" or, for example, \"identical\" or \"literal\". Declarations in diluted or modified form (stating, for example, that the translation is \"practically complete\" or that the contents \"are essentially the same\") cannot be accepted. The same applies to cases where the declaration is obviously incorrect (e.g. if several priorities are claimed for a single European application or if the European application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed). In all these cases a complete translation must be filed. Where the European application contains claims on its date of filing and the priority application did not contain claims on its filing date or contained fewer claims on its filing date than the subsequent European application, the declaration cannot be accepted. A merely different arrangement of the various elements of the application (e.g \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4\n\nContent: . Instead, there arose a legal fiction that the priority period had been observed, even though the filing date was actually later than that period's expiry date. InT 382/94(OJ 1998, 24) the board held that if the drawings were filed in full on the date of filing, they formed part of the application as filed, even if they contained text matter in an official language other than the language of the proceedings. There was nothing to prevent the application being amended on the basis of a translation of this text matter into the language of the proceedings. The language requirements for a European patent application were amended under the EPC 2000, see chapterIII.F.1. \"Language of filing and date of filing of a European patent application\". InJ 1/12the appellant had filed a European patent application with the UK Patent Office with the same documents as those underlying the later application before the EPO. The application in the UK never reached the EPO. The Legal Board therefore had to consider whether, contrary toArt. 80 EPC 1973, it was justified to assign the application the earlier filing date (Art. 75(1)(b) EPC 1973).Art. 77(2) EPC 1973provides that European patent applications filed within the member states are to be forwarded to the EPO within six weeks after filing.Art. 77(5) EPC 1973supplements this provision by providing that European patent applications which do not reach the EPO before the specified time limit are deemed to be withdrawn. It followed that the application filed with the UK Patent Office was deemed to have been withdrawn. No re-establishment of rights is provided for. In such a situation the legislator expressly provides in the last sentence ofArt. 77(5) EPC 1973for the refund of the filing, search and designation fees.

Upon request the patent proprietor must pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims and file a formally compliant version of the entire description.**\n\nThis is because according to the guidelines, once the interlocutory decision is finalized or the amended text is drawn up in opposition appeal proceedings, the formalities officer requests the patent proprietor to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims in the two official languages of the EPO other than the language of the proceedings, and file a formally compliant version of the amended text passages.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not align with the procedural requirements outlined in the guidelines. Specifically, Option B suggests that the patent proprietor will not be invited to perform these actions unless an appeal is filed, whereas Options C and D incorrectly suggest that the formalities officer invites the patent proprietor to perform these actions together with the interlocutory decision, and that the patent proprietor should file a typed version of the amended paragraph rather than a formally compliant version.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: (a) Paying the fee for publishing a new specification and filing a translation of sets of claims in in the official languages of the European Patent Office other than the language of the proceedings.  (b) Within two months of a communication [(pursuant to Rule 95(3) EPC) in conjunction with Rule 82(3) EPC (Form 2386)] pointing out the failure to observe the time limit, the omitted acts must be performed and the surcharge for late performance of the acts required to maintain the European patent in amended form must be paid.  (c) The only possibility is re-establishment of rights.  (d) Within 3 months of the mention of the publication of the B2, a translation in Italian of the patent specification as maintained in amended form must be filed at the Italian Patent Office.

Content: 7.2.1 Procedural requirements A decision to maintain the patent in amended form may be delivered only when the patent proprietor has approved the new text on the basis of which the opposition division intends to maintain the patent and the opponent has had sufficient opportunity to comment on the proposed new text. A decision to maintain the patent in amended form may be delivered only when the patent proprietor has approved the new text on the basis of which the opposition division intends to maintain the patent and the opponent has had sufficient opportunity to comment on the proposed new text. Both prerequisites can be fulfilled during oral proceedings at which the opposition division establishes the text including the amended description and, if necessary, the amended figures.In written proceedings, the necessary opportunity to comment on the new text on the basis of which the opposition division intends to maintain the patent is given to the opponent when a communication is issued to the parties. Once these requirements have been met, a separate communication underRule 82(1)is neither necessary nor appropriate (seeG 1/88). If the patent can be maintained in the amended form, the opposition division tries to obtain the patent proprietor's approval of the text in which the patent can be maintained and gives the opponent an opportunity to comment on it. An interlocutory decision can then be delivered. If these requirements have still not been met and no oral proceedings are being held, a communication underArt. 101(1)must be issued. This also applies when it has been established in principle that the patent can be maintained in a particular form but a complete text expressly approved by the patent proprietor is not yet available. The patent proprietor's approval of an amended version of the patent need not be given in a separate, express declaration; it may also be apparent from the circumstances, in particular from the fact that an amended version was filed or requested. This applies equally to versions which have been filed as an auxiliary request.

Content: 8.7.3 Procedure in opposition proceedings The preferred way to amend the description during oral proceedings in opposition is by submitting amended paragraphs replacing specific numbered paragraphs of the B-publication of the patent. This allows the opposition division and the opponents to verify the amendments efficiently. It is not necessary to supply entire amended pages. Rule 82(2), third sentence, provides for one exception to the principle that a decision determining the final text of the patent may be based only on formally compliant documents. Pursuant to this provision, in oral opposition proceedings, the patent proprietor is by way of exception not required to file documents compliant with the requirements of Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022 (OJ EPO 2022, A113) prior to the interlocutory decision on the documents on the basis of which the patent is to be maintained. The proprietor may choose to submit a formally compliant version of the amended text only within the time limit underRule 82(2)(OJ EPO 2016, A22). The parties will nevertheless be encouraged to file compliant documents during oral opposition proceedings. In contrast, in written opposition proceedings, an interlocutory decision to maintain the patent as amended may be issued only on the basis of formally compliant documents since the invitation inRule 82(2)applies only to documents filed during oral proceedings (seeH‑IV, 5.3). If, in oral proceedings, the interlocutory decision of the opposition division was based on documents which do not comply with Art. 2(7) of the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, i.e. which contain handwritten amendments, the opposition division will invite the proprietor in the communication underRule 82(2)to file a formally compliant version of the amended text. The invitation will specify the formally deficient amended paragraphs and/or claims for which replacement paragraphs and/or claims need to be filed \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 8.7.3\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.3. Content: 7.2.3 Request for publishing fee, translations and a formally compliant version of amended text passages Once the interlocutory decision becomes final or the amended text in which the patent is to be maintained has been drawn up in opposition appeal proceedings, the formalities officer requests the patent proprietor Once the interlocutory decision becomes final or the amended text in which the patent is to be maintained has been drawn up in opposition appeal proceedings, the formalities officer requests the patent proprietor –to pay, within three months, the fee for publishing a new specification of the European patent; –to file translations of any amended claims in the two official languages of the EPO other than the language of the proceedings; and –to file a formally compliant verbatim version of amended text passages if in oral opposition proceedings the interlocutory decision of the opposition division underArt. 101(3)(a)andArticle106(2)or the board of appeal decision underArt. 111(2)has been based on documents not complying withRule 50(1)(seeE‑III, 8.7). If the European patent in the amended form contains different claims for different contracting states, a translation of all sets of claims – in the text communicated to the patent proprietor – into all official languages other than the language of the proceedings must be filed. Rule 82(2) If the request under the first paragraph above is not complied with \"in due time\", the acts may still be validly performed within two months of notification of a communication pointing out the failure to observe the time limit, provided that within this two-month period the prescribed surcharge is paid. If any of the acts is not performed within the period of grace, the formalities officer will issue a decision for revocation of the patent in accordance withRule 82(3).

Correction of the translations of the claims According toArt. 70(1), the text of a patent in the language of the proceedings is the authentic text. It therefore follows that the translations of the claims of the patent specification required byArt. 14(6)are for information only. Hence no examination of the translations takes place (C‑V, 1.3); in particular, the translations do not form part of the decision to grant the patent. Therefore they cannot be corrected underRule 140, either. However, if when a corrected version of a translation of the claims is received, the stage of preparations for the B publication still allows the exchange of documents, the EPO will publish the corrected version instead of the original version of the translation.

Art. 14(4) In the case of European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2014and international applications entering the European phase on or after that date,a 30% reduction of the filing and/or examination fee for certain categories of applicants is provided for. For international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2014, a 30% reduction of the examination fee is provided for(see the notice from the EPO dated 10 January 2014,OJ EPO 2014, A23). In this regard, it is necessary to file the documents making up the application \"as filed\" and/or the request for examination in an admissible non‑EPO language, and to file the translation not earlier than simultaneously (seeG 6/91).

Where the EPO invites the applicant to file the translation (seeA‑VII, 1.4), the invitation will be sent by default in English with an update to the language of the proceedings on receipt of the translation, if applicable. The language of the proceedings is the only language used by EPO departments in written proceedings on that application (seeG 4/08). Art. 14(3) Where European patent applications are filed in one of the official EPO languages, or after they have been translated into one of them, the description, claims and drawings can only be amended in that official language, which is the language of the proceedings. Any claims filed after the filing date will need to be filed in the language of the proceedings. Example: If an application is filed without claims in Japanese and is then translated into English, the claims will need to be filed in English. Subsequent amendments to the application will also have to the filed in English.

Translation of the application There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: (i)the European patent application was filed according toArt. 14(2)in a non‑EPO language (ii)the European patent application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in a non‑EPO language (Rule 40(3)) (iii)the European divisional application was filed in the same language as the earlier (parent) application on which it is based, where this was not an official EPO language (Rule 36(2)– seeA‑IV, 1.3.3). In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according toRule 6(1)(for type (i)) orRule 40(3)(for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according toRule 36(2). Art. 14(2)Rule 6(1) The EPO will check compliance with this requirement. If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency underRule 58within two months in accordance with the procedure explained inA‑III, 16. Art. 90(3)Rule 57(a) Failure to file the translation on time in response to the invitation underRule 58results in the application being deemed withdrawn according toArt. 14(2). The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1). Further processing is ruled out byRule 135(2)for the above time limits for supplying the translation underRule 40(3),Rule 6(1)andRule 36(2)and for the time limit for rectifying the failure to file the translation underRule 58 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4. Content: 3.4 Translation of the previous application A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. A translation of the previous application into one of the official languages of the EPO is required only if it is needed for determining the validity of the priority claim, where this is of relevance to the patentability of the underlying invention. The translation must be filed within the time limit set by the EPO. For more details on the procedure, seeA‑III, 6.8and subsections. Alternatively, underRule 53(3), a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within that same time limit. This declaration must be unambiguous, stating that the translation is \"complete\" or, for example, \"identical\" or \"literal\". Declarations in diluted or modified form (stating, for example, that the translation is \"practically complete\" or that the contents \"are essentially the same\") cannot be accepted. The same applies to cases where the declaration is obviously incorrect (e.g. if several priorities are claimed for a single European application or if the European application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed). In all these cases a complete translation must be filed. Where the European application contains claims on its date of filing and the priority application did not contain claims on its filing date or contained fewer claims on its filing date than the subsequent European application, the declaration cannot be accepted.

            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To determine whether the missing priority claim can still be validly added, we need to understand the rules regarding priority claims in international patent applications.\n\nFrom the provided content:\n\n1. **Priority Claims**: Priority claims can be added to an international patent application if they were not claimed when the application was initially filed. This allows the applicant to claim priority from different applications that were filed before the current application.\n\n2. **Time Limit for Adding Priority Claim**: According to the guidelines, the applicant has two months from the original filing date to claim priority. The original filing date is determined by the date on which the international application was filed.\n\nGiven the dates mentioned:\n- Original filing date: 7 July 2022 (EP-I)\n- Current filing date: 12 October 2023\n\nWe calculate the deadline:\n- Two months after 7 July 2022 = 29 September 2022\n- Extended to Sunday, 6 February 2023 (as per the rule)\n\nSince today is 12 October 2023, the deadline has already passed. Therefore, the applicant cannot add the missing priority claim because the time limit has expired.\n\nThus, the correct answer is D. No, the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023.\n\nFinal answer: **D. No, the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023.**\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: (a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) together with the confirmation. Within two months of the original filing date 5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 6 February. (b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together with the confirmation). RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 2023 (c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. (d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of technical preparations for the publication. Publication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, which is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). The technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the date of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on Tuesday, 6 June). \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json\n\nContent: .1(b)PCTorRule 17.1(b-bis) PCT, the EPO may not ask the applicant himself to furnish a copy. Where the file number or the copy of the previous application has not yet been submitted at the expiry of the 31-month time limit, the EPO invites the applicant to furnish the number or the copy within two months. However,Rule 53(2)and the decision of the President of the EPO dated 18 October 2018,OJ EPO 2018, A78, providing an exception to the requirement that a copy of the previous application be furnished (seeA‑III, 6.7), also apply to international applications entering the European phase. Furthermore, where the applicant has complied withRule 17.1(a)PCT,Rule 17.1(b)PCTorRule 17.1(b-bis) PCTthe EPO as a designated Office may not ask the applicant himself to furnish it with a copy of the priority document (Rule 17.2(a) PCT, second sentence). If the priority document is not on file, substantive examination may nevertheless be started, provided that neither intermediate documents (published in the priority period) norArt. 54(3)documents exist which cause the patentability of the subject-matter claimed to depend on the validity of the priority right. However, no European patent may be granted until such time as the priority document is on file. In such a case, the applicant is informed that the decision to grant will not be taken as long as the priority document is missing. On the other hand, the application may be refused without the priority document being on file, provided that the relevant prior art is neither an intermediate document nor anArt. 54(3)document, the relevance of which depends on the validity of the priority right. For more details on treatment of such cases in examination seeF‑VI, 3.4 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1\n\nContent: .The EPC does not set out any formal requirements for the transfer of the priority right (seeG 1/22andG 2/22).Where the previous application was filed by joint applicants, all of them must be among the later European patent application's applicants or have transferred their rights in the priority application to the later European patent application's applicant (seeT 844/18).Proof of the transfer can be filed later.Yet, absent any substantiated indication to the contrary, there is a strong rebuttable presumption under the EPC that an applicant or joint applicants claiming priority in accordance withArt. 88(1)andRule 52are also entitled to the claimed priority. The burden of proof is shifted, and the examining division, opponent or third party challenging an applicant's entitlement to priority has to prove that this entitlement is missing. Especially where an international application under the PCT is filed by joint applicants, including the priority applicant, but without naming the priority applicant as applicant for the European designation, the mere fact of the joint filing implies an agreement between the applicants allowing all of them to rely on the priority right unless substantial facts indicate otherwise (seeG 1/22andG 2/22). However, in the case of joint applicants filing the later European patent application, it is sufficient if one of the applicants is the previous application's applicant or their successor in title. There is no need for a special transfer of the priority right to the other applicant(s), since the later European patent application has been filed jointly. The same applies where the previous application itself was filed by joint applicants, provided that all of them, or their successor(s) in title, are among the later European patent application's joint applicants. As concerns (iii), the priority period starts on the day following the first application's filing date (Art. 4C(2) Paris Convention andRule 131(2)). Accordingly, where a priority claim relates to an application filed on the same day as the European patent application, it will be disregarded (see, however, alsoA‑III, 6.6). Art \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.1\n\nContent: 1. EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1 (31 August 2024, extended to 2 September 2024), so priority can be added. The declaration of priority can be made up to 16 months from earliest priority date: 31 December 2024, extended to 2 January 2025. An applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating: i. the date of the previous application ii. the state or WTO member in or for which it was filed iii. the application number 2. The applicant may file of their own volition the correct description within two months of filing (Rule 56a EPC): 2 November 2024, extended to 4 November 2024. Since priority was not claimed on filing, Rule 56a(4) EPC does not apply. The application is re-dated. 3. As the new filing date falls outside the 12-month priority period, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period should also be filed, together with reasons. And the fee should be paid. \nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_open.json\n\nContent: . For instance, where the international application contained a description and a claim or claims on the international filing date, it is not possible to replace these elements with elements from a priority application. It is also not possible to add elements from a priority application if this would result in the international application having, for instance, two (or more) descriptions or two (or more) sets of claims. As of 1 July 2020, such cases may however be handled by the receiving Office underRule 20.5bisPCT(seeE‑IX, 2.9.4for the determination of the filing date in such a case).

In the case of missing parts, the applicant may also request that the missing part concerned be disregarded in the European patent grant procedure. In that case, the missing part will be considered not to have been furnished and the EPO will not treat the international application as if the international filing date had been corrected.

This is because the appeal was filed within the time limit but the original nine-month period for filing the opposition was not available due to the limitation procedure being completed before the appeal was filed.

The renewal fee in respect of the third year may not be validly paid more than six months before it falls due. All other renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due. (2) FootnoteRef80 If a renewal fee is not paid on the due date under paragraph 1 , the fee may still be paid within six months of the said date, provided that an additional fee is also paid within that period. The legal consequence laid down in Article 86, paragraph 1 , shall ensue upon expiry of the six-month period. (3) Renewal fees already due in respect of an earlier application at the date on which a divisional application is filed shall also be paid for the divisional application and shall be due on its filing. These fees and any renewal fee due within four months of filing the divisional application may be paid within that period without an additional fee. Paragraph 2 shall apply. (4) If a European patent application has been refused or deemed to be withdrawn as a result of non-observance of a time limit, and if the applicant's rights are re-established under Article 122 , a renewal fee (a) which would have fallen due under paragraph 1 in the period starting on the date on which the loss of rights occurred, up to and including the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights, shall be due on that latter date. This fee and any renewal fee due within four months from that latter date may still be paid within four months of that latter date without an additional fee. Paragraph 2 shall apply. (b) which, on the date on which the loss of rights has occurred, was already due but the period provided for in paragraph 2 has not yet expired, may still be paid within six months from the date of the notification of the decision re-establishing the rights, provided that the additional fee pursuant to paragraph 2 is also paid within that period \nSource: EPC Rule 51\n\nContent: Legal basis Art 86 EPC, Rule 51 EPC, Art 141 EPC Due date of the renewal fee: 30 November 2023 = atier grant of the patent renewal fee must be paid to the national offices.

(b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)). (c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC.

            "Question": " On 22 December 2022, Italian company X filed an international patent application PCT -X at the EPO as receiving Office. PCT -X claims priority from European patent application EP-X filed on 11 January 2022. The EPO as International Searching Authority issued a search report, together with a negative written opinion (WO -ISA) and transmitted them to the applicant on 11 May 2023. Company X would like to overcome the objections raised in the WO -ISA before deciding on national phase entry . What acts should be performed before which authority, and by when? ",
            "Answer": "(a) X should file a demand (using Form PCT/IPEA/401) (mention of Art 34 accepted) at the EPO and specifying the EPO as IPEA.  (b) The time limit for filing the demand is 22 months from priority (11 November 2023 (Saturday) extended to 13 November 2023 (Monday)) or 3 months from SR (11 August 2023 (Friday)).  (c) File a reply (with amendments) to the written opinion and pay the fee for preliminary examination and the handling fee (to the EPO).",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the question, we need to determine the appropriate actions and authorities involved before the EPO.\n\n1. **International Searching Authority (ISA)**: The EPO acts as the International Searching Authority (ISA) for the PCT.\n   - **Action**: Request an international preliminary examination (IPEA).\n   - **By When**: Within 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed.\n\n2. **International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA)**: The EPO acts as the IPEA for the PCT.\n   - **Action**: File a demand for international preliminary examination with the EPO.\n   - **By When**: Within 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**The correct answer is:**\n- **Request an international preliminary examination (IPEA)** before the EPO.\n- **File a demand for international preliminary examination with the EPO** before the EPO.\n\nThis action must be taken within the 16-month period after the priority date or, if necessary, after the priority date as adjusted due to corrections or additions.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: Q4-1 PCT Direct procedure (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1-3).Q4-2 The EPO has to be used as International Searching Authority (OJ EPO 2014, A89, 1) because PCT Direct is a service offered by the EPO. Receiving office can be any office open to a German applicant (OJ EPO 2017, A21): DPMA, IB, EPO. Q4-3 Taiwan is not a PCT contracting state (PCT Applicant's Guide ‒ International Phase – Annex A). The solution is to file national patent application in Taiwan within the priority year, claiming priority of the European patent application. Q4-4. 10 November 2022. (Rule 26bis.1(a)) The applicant may correct a priority claim or add a priority claim to the request by a notice submitted to the receiving Office or the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date or, where the correction or addition would cause a change in the priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 16-month period expires first, provided that such a notice may be submitted until the expiration of four months from the international filing date. 16 months from 10 July 2021 (earlier of 2 priority dates) = 10 November 2022 4 months from 3 June 2022 = 3 October 2022 The answer is therefore 10 November 2022, as it is later than 3 October 2022. Q4-5 7 August 2023. (Rule 54bis.1(a)): 22 months from priority date or 3 months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and of the written opinion established under R. 43bis.1, whichever period expires later. 7 October 2021 + 22 months = 7 August 2023. Receipt of the international search report on 1 September 2022 + 3 months = 1 December 2022, which is earlier.

An extension of the time limit would delay the prosecution of A1 until the new deadline is reached.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: (a) (Rule 64(1)) has a deadline of 2m from the notification of the communication, therefore the 10-day rule still currently applies. 5 September 2023 + 10d = 15 September 2023 + 2m = 15 November 2023.  (b) No action is required. If no response is filed to the R64(1) communication, the published search report will be based on the first mentioned invention (i.e., A1).  (c) Pay two additional search fees (before the calculated deadline of 15 November 2023). A further search report will be issued covering all three inventions.  (d) Request examination for EP-A and file a divisional application for the second invention. (e) A PPH request based on the US-priority application with the USPTO as OEE cannot be filed by using Form 1009 (as the US priority is still under substantive examination). EPO Form 1005 can be used to request accelerated examination (PACE).

Content: 6.1 General remarks A European patent applicant is entitled to – and may claim – the priority of an earlier first application where: A European patent applicant is entitled to – and may claim – the priority of an earlier first application where: (i)the previous application was filed in or for a state or WTO member recognised as giving rise to a priority right in accordance with the provisions of the EPC (see alsoA‑III, 6.2) (ii)the European patent applicant was the applicant who made the previous application or is their successor in title (iii)the European patent application is made during a period of twelve months from the previous application's filing date (see, however,A‑III, 6.6) and (iv)the European patent application concerns the same invention as the invention disclosed in the previous application (see alsoA‑III, 6.4andF‑VI, 1), which must be the \"first application\" (seeF‑VI, 1.4and1.4.1). As concerns (i), the previous application may be an application for a patent, the registration of a utility model or a utility certificate. However, a priority right based on the deposit of an industrial design is not recognised (seeJ 15/80). Art. 87(1),Art. 87(2)andArt. 87(5) So long as the contents of the previous application were sufficient to establish a filing date, that date can be used to determine a priority date, irrespective of the outcome (e.g. subsequent withdrawal or refusal) of the application.

            "Question": " A large German company filed a German patent application on 10 April 2022 and received a search report for it on 20 October 2022. The same company filed a European patent application on 10 June 2022, claiming priority from the German application. The minimum amount of fees was paid on filing. The European application was published yesterday, 11 October 2023, together with the search report. 1.  After having analysed the search report issued by the EPO, the applicant wants to maintain its application and obtain a patent. Set out all procedural steps and actions that must be taken to get the first communication under Article 94(3) EPC or Rule 71(3) EPC as soon as possible. Fee amounts need not be specified. 2.  By when must these actions be taken at the latest? Show your calculations. 3.  Let us now assume that the response to the search opinion did not include any amendment or correction of the application, and the first communication from the examining division is a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC sent in December 2023 without any proposed amendment. The applicant confirms that it agrees with the text set out in the communication and files the required translations of the claims. The applicant would like to have the broadest possible territorial scope of protection. Which fees will you pay if the applicant would like to obtain the grant of the patent as soon as possible? Please also specify the fee amounts. 4. If, however, the applicant is interested in delaying the grant without incurring any additional expenses, what is the latest date for paying each of the fees listed in your answer to question 3? ",
            "Answer": "(a) The applicant must respond to the search opinion if required/if negative or confirm that the applicant desires to proceed further with his application in case no response to the search opinion is required (Rule 70(2); Gui C-II, 1.1), pay the examination fee, send a copy of the search results on the priority application (without waiting for a communication from the Examining Division (Gui C-II, 5)) and file a PACE request.  (b) 6 months from publication of the search report (or application), i.e. 11 October 2023 + 6 months = Thursday 11 April 2024. The copy of the search results must be filed within two months from notification of the invitation (Rule 141(3) EPC).  (c) Designation fee: 660 EUR.  - Extension fee Montenegro: 102 EUR (Montenegro became a contracting state on 1.10.2022, thus was not designated on 10.6.2022 (extension)). - Extension fee for Bosnia and Herzegovina:  102 EUR   - Validation fee for Morocco:                            240 EUR   - Validation fee for the Republic of Moldova:   200 EUR  Fee for grant: 1040 EUR   (d) The fee for grant must be paid within 4 months from notification of the communication under Rule 71(3). All other fees must be paid 6 months from the publication of the application: (11 Oct 2023 + 6m = Thursday 11 April 2024).",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the questions regarding the fees and procedures involved:\n\n### Question 1: Procedural Steps and Actions Required to Obtain First Communication under Article 94(3) EPC or Rule 71(3) EPC\n\nAfter analyzing the search report, the applicant should follow these steps:\n\n1. **File Translations of Claims**: File the translations of the claims into English and German.\n   - **Filing Date**: As per the search report, the claim translations should be filed within two months of the filing of the application.\n\n2. **Pay Fees for Translation of Claims**: Pay the fees for translating the claims into English and German.\n   - **Fee Amount**: This fee is typically included in the filing fee and search fee, so it does not need to be separately calculated here.\n\n3. **Notify National Professional Representative for Validation**: Appoint and instruct a national professional representative to validate the application in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Malta.\n   - **Action Needed**: Notify the national professional representative to proceed with validation.\n\n4. **Validate Application in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Malta**: File the translations of the claims in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Malta.\n   - **Date**: The application must be validated within two months of receiving the search report.\n\n### Question 2: When These Actions Must Be Taken\n\nBased on the above steps, the applicant should notify the national professional representative to proceed with validation within two months of receiving the search report. Therefore, the latest date for taking these actions is:\n\n- **Latest Date**: Two months from the date the search report was received, which is 20 October 2022.\n\n### Question 3: Fees to be Paid for Granting the Patent\n\nIf the applicant desires the grant of the patent as soon as possible, they should pay the following fees:\n\n1. **Filing Fee**: The filing fee has already been paid upon filing the application.\n2. **Search Fee**: The search fee has already been paid upon filing the application.\n3. **Grant and Printing Fee**: The applicant should pay the fee for granting the patent and printing.\n   - **Fee Amount**: This fee is typically included in the filing fee and search fee, so it does not need to be separately calculated here.\n\n### Question 4: Latest Date for Paying Each Fee\n\nGiven the applicant's desire to delay the grant without incurring additional expenses, the latest date for paying each fee should be:\n\n1. **Filing Fee\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: (a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD).

All fees that fell due before publication of the application with the search report were paid in time. In response to the search  opinion, your employer immediately requested examination and filed a set of 20 claims. The application and the amended claims were published on 19 April 2023, together with the search report. The EPO examining division has issued a communication under Rul e 71(3) EPC dated 12 October 2023; it has not proposed any amendments. Your employer agrees to the text communicated under Rule 71(3) EPC and asks you to \"obtain the patent\" as soon as possible and at the lowest cost with a view to starting infringement pr oceedings in Belgium, Latvia and Malta.

It is specified that the debit order is to be executed on 18 October 2024. On the evening of 10 October 2024, the applicant notices that the renewal fee is not yet due and should not be debited from the deposit account. What is the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP)?\n A. 10 October 2024\nB. 17 October 2024\nC. 18 October 2024\nD.

Therefore, these points are not relevant to the question about revoking the order to debit the renewal fee.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: .04.2020 Earliest date for valid payment of fourth-year renewal fee underRule 51(1) 31.07.2020 Due date for fourth year renewal fee underRule 51(1) Renewal fee payments made before the permissible prepayment periods are not valid. If a debit order for a renewal fee is received via Central Fee Payment before the earliest valid payment dates underRule 51(1), it will be rejected at source by the validation functionality (seeA‑X, 4.2.3). If a payment is made too early either by filing a valid debit order via OLF and Online Filing 2.0 or by using any other payment method (i.e. bank transfer or credit card), the renewal fee will be refunded by the EPO according to the procedures laid down inA‑X, 10. Rule 51(1) If the renewal fee has not been validly paid on or before the due date, it may still be validly paid within six months of the said date, provided that the additional fee is paid within this period. The additional fee can be paid until the last day of the sixth month following the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing (seeJ 4/91, reasons 2.7). This six-month period begins on the last day of the month referred to inRule 51(1), first sentence, even if the circumstances described inRule 134(1),(2)and(5)apply.Rule 134is applicable to the calculation of the expiry of the six-month time limit for payment of the additional fee (seeJ 4/91, reasons 3.2). Whilst a notice draws the applicant's attention to the possibility underRule 51(2)andArt. 2(1), item 5, RFees, the omission of such notification may not be invoked (seeJ 12/84andJ 1/89).

The party is informed of any such correction by means of a communication from the EPO providing a two-month period for objection in the event of disagreement by the party. In that case, the fee will be debited as indicated in the (erroneous) debit order or, if applicable, any corrective booking executed will be reverted. The principles outlined above, however, do not allow the correction of a debit order by adding any fee that is not indicated in it, even if, according to the status of proceedings, that fee is due on the date of receipt of the debit order. Point 10.2 ADA A debit order may be revoked in whole or in part by the person making the payment by sending a signed written notice tosupport@epo.orgby email or by completing the online contact form available on the EPO website (epo.org) and submitting it together with the signed written notice. For a debit order revocation notice to be effective, it must be received by the EPO no later than on the date on which the debit order is received. A debit order with deferred payment date may be revoked in Central Fee Payment until one day before the intended execution date or at the latest on the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to the EPO as indicated above. Point 13 ADA Payments via deposit account effected in Central Fee Payment are validated, meaning that the debit order for a fee is automatically rejected if the fee falls within one of the following categories: –renewal fees and fees for the transfer of rights made in respect of patent applications for which the loss of rights or the refusal has become final –renewal fees for granted European patents –renewal fees received before the earliest valid payment dates underRule 51(1) –double-payments for fees that can be paid only once in the proceedings before the EPO.

This deferred due date, and hence the expiry of another period (the 31-month period), forms the basis for calculating the additional period for payment of the renewal fee with an additional fee (seeJ 1/89, the principles of which apply). For example: 20.04.2016 (Wed) Priority date 17.10.2016 (Mon) Filing date 31.10.2018 (Wed) Due date for third-year renewal fee underRule 51(1) 20.11.2018 (Tue) Expiry of 31-month period underRule 159(1)= deferred due date for third-year renewal fee 20.05.2019 (Mon) Last day for payment of the renewal fee (plus additional fee) since the six-month period underRule 51(2)expires that day If the applicant requests entry into the regional phase before the expiry of the 31-month period (seeArt. 23(2) PCTandArt. 40(2) PCT), in order for the request to become effective the renewal fee in respect of the third year has to be paid if the fee has fallen due earlier underRule 51(1).

Instead, there arose a legal fiction that the priority period had been observed, even though the filing date was actually later than that period's expiry date. InT 382/94(OJ 1998, 24) the board held that if the drawings were filed in full on the date of filing, they formed part of the application as filed, even if they contained text matter in an official language other than the language of the proceedings. There was nothing to prevent the application being amended on the basis of a translation of this text matter into the language of the proceedings. The language requirements for a European patent application were amended under the EPC 2000, see chapterIII.F.1. \"Language of filing and date of filing of a European patent application\". InJ 1/12the appellant had filed a European patent application with the UK Patent Office with the same documents as those underlying the later application before the EPO. The application in the UK never reached the EPO. The Legal Board therefore had to consider whether, contrary toArt. 80 EPC 1973, it was justified to assign the application the earlier filing date (Art. 75(1)(b) EPC 1973).Art. 77(2) EPC 1973provides that European patent applications filed within the member states are to be forwarded to the EPO within six weeks after filing.Art. 77(5) EPC 1973supplements this provision by providing that European patent applications which do not reach the EPO before the specified time limit are deemed to be withdrawn. It followed that the application filed with the UK Patent Office was deemed to have been withdrawn. No re-establishment of rights is provided for. In such a situation the legislator expressly provides in the last sentence ofArt. 77(5) EPC 1973for the refund of the filing, search and designation fees.

You received a communication dated 25 September 2024 from the EPO acting as International Searching Authority (ISA), stating that the requirement of unity of invention has not been complied with. The ISA identifies three inventions. You are invited to pay two additional search fees. Which of the following statements is correct?\n A. You must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024\nB. You do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results\nC. If you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must pay two protest fees within the time limit\nD. If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn",

Incorrect: if the applicant does not pay any additional search fees, the information appearing in the invitation to pay additional fees will be considered to be  the result of the international search and will be included as such in the international search report",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: You must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024.\n\nExplanation: According to the guidelines provided, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay search fees for any unsearched sub-inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period under Rule 161(1), in accordance with Rule 164(2). Therefore, statement A is correct. Statement B is incorrect because the applicant can respond to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. Statement C is incorrect because the applicant can pay two additional search fees under protest and then pay two protest fees within the time limit. Statement D is incorrect because the international patent application will not be deemed to be withdrawn if the applicant does not pay any additional search fees within the time limit.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: .B. \"Unity of invention\". The current protest procedure underR. 158(3) EPCand the preceding interim procedure are dealt with in chapterII.B.1. A case inthe same vein wasT 506/08, in whichthe EPO, acting as ISA, had issued a declaration of non-establishment of the ISR underArt. 17(2)(a) PCT. The examining division did not carry out a further search on the amended application, which it subsequently refused for lack of inventive step. At the appeal stage the applicant filed a request for a (partial) refund of the international search fee. However, the board declined jurisdiction to deal with the request. The guarantee of due process of law (cf.G 3/08date: 2010-05-12,OJ 2011, 10), as invoked by the appellant, did not mean that each and every claim against the EPO was a matter for the boards (e.g.J 14/87,OJ 1988, 295; with reference toArt. 9 EPC 1973). Once a Euro-PCT application enters the regional phase before the EPO, the appeal procedures provided for under the EPC supplement the provisions of the PCT (J 20/89,OJ 1991, 375). See also in this chapterVI.3. \nSource: Case Law VI, 2\n\nContent: . (iii)If additional search fees have been paid during the international phase, the applicant may determine that the application is to proceed on the basis of any of the searched inventions, the other(s) being deleted, if the examining division agrees with the objection of the ISA. Where the applicants have not yet taken that decision, the examining division will, at the beginning of substantive examination, invite them to do so. (iv)If the claims to be examined relate to an invention which differs from any of the originally claimed inventions, the examining division will proceed to issue an invitation underRule 164(2)to pay search fees for any claimed invention in the application documents not covered by the international search report or supplementary international search report, if any (seeC‑III, 3.1). (v)If the applicant has not paid additional search fees during the international phase and the examining division does not agree with the objection of the ISA (for example, because the applicant has convincingly argued in response to the WO‑ISA or IPER, seeE‑IX, 3.3.1, that the requirement of unity of invention is satisfied), an additional search will be performed (seeB‑II, 4.2(iii)) and the examination will be carried out on all claims. Rule 164(2) In cases (i) to (iv), the applicant may file divisional applications for the inventions deleted to meet the objection of non-unity (seeC‑IX, 1andA‑IV, 1), provided that, when a divisional application is filed, the application being divided is still pending (seeA‑IV, 1.1.1). Rule 36(1) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-V, 7.1\n\nContent: . According toT 94/91,Art. 82 EPC 1973clearly provided that European patent applications must satisfy the criteria of unity of invention without any restriction. There was no difference in the EPC 1973 between \"a priori\" and \"a posteriori\" lack of unity. It was of no importance whether the non-unity appeared immediately or only in view of a document found during the search or the examination. This was also the interpretation given in the Guidelines and inG 2/89(OJ 1991, 166), which, although it related to PCT applications, concerned a similar procedure. Where the search division makes a finding of non-unity, the applicant is normally informed, along with the partial search report relating to the invention, or group of inventions, first mentioned in the claims, that a further search fee must be paid for the other inventions which it wishes to be covered by the European search report (R. 64(1) EPC).Art. 17(3)(a) PCTlays down the equivalent procedure before the ISA.R. 164 EPCcontains special provisions for Euro-PCT applications having entered the European phase. Relevant decisions are summarised in this chapterII.B.6. \"Plurality of inventions – further search fees\". \nSource: Case Law II, B.3.2\n\nContent: (a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)). (c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC. If documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted by the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be received on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the period shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are available (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120). \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json\n\nContent: . 17(3)(a) PCTandRule 40 PCTbeing further subdivided and resulting in sub-inventions not originally identified in that invitation (v)The EPO did not search all such sub-inventions. In the above case, the EPO will invite the applicant to pay search fees for any such unsearched sub-inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period underRule 161(1), in accordance withRule 164(2). Where the EPO acted as SISA in accordance withRule 45bis.9 PCT, it may make a finding of a lack of unity of the international application according toRule 45bis.6(a) PCT. However, in the procedure before the SISA, the applicant cannot pay additional supplementary international search fees, and the supplementary international search report will be directed only to the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT). Where such an application contains unsearched inventions in the claims that are to form the basis for examination on expiry of the six-month period underRule 161(1), a communication underRule 164(2)is issued allowing the applicant to have these inventions searched upon payment of search fees and to pursue one of them in the examination proceedings. Rule 164(2)(b)provides for a right to amend the application in response to the results of any search underRule 164(2). This means that applicants may make amendments of their own volition once in response to the communication underArt. 94(3)to which the search results underRule 164(2)are annexed (H‑II, 2.3).

Content: 3. Transfer of the European patent application A European patent application may be transferred for one or more of the designated contracting states. A European patent application may be transferred for one or more of the designated contracting states. Art. 71 Art. 72is an autonomous provision which exclusively governs the formal requirements of such transfers. The EPO registers a transfer of rights in respect of a pending European patent application (seeA‑IV, 1.1.1andJ 10/93) in the European Patent Register on request, upon fulfilment of the prerequisites ofRule 22. The request is not deemed to have been filed until an administrative fee has been paid. The amount of the fee is determined by the latest schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (seeepo.org). Where the request relates to multiple applications, a separate fee has to be paid for each application. With effect from the entry into force of amendedRule 22(1)on 1 April 2024, the conditions under which payment of an administrative fee is due is laid down by the President of the EPO. Rule 22furthermore requires the production of documents providing evidence of such a transfer. Any kind of written evidence suitable for proving the transfer is admissible. This includes formal documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (the original or a copy thereof) or other official documents or extracts thereof, provided that they immediately verify the transfer (J 12/00).Art. 72requires that, for an assignment, the signatures of the parties appear on the documents submitted as evidence of the transfer. Assignment documents filed electronically (seeA‑II, 1.1.1A‑II, 1.2.2) may, instead of handwritten signatures, bear qualified electronic signatures (see notice from the EPO dated 22 October 2021;OJ EPO 2021, A86) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIV, 3\n\n"

These paragraphs, in conjunction with paragraph 2 of the same rule, established unequivocally that the time limits were fixed in full years, months and weeks, without any possibility of their being reduced or extended (see alsoJ 9/82,OJ 1983, 57). InJ 13/88the Legal Board demonstrated how to calculate the 12-month priority period referred to inArt. 87 EPC. The event representing the point in time from which a time limit started to run was the filing date of the application in respect of which priority was claimed, which was 5 May 1986. The period expired in the relevant subsequent month on the day which had the same number as the day on which the said event occurred, which was 5 May 1987 (R. 131(2)and(4) EPC). T 2056/08concerns the calculation of the period for filing an appeal when combined with a ten-day period for postal delivery. The board noted that the two-month period stipulated inArt. 108 EPCstarted from the day of the presumed or actual notification. If any rule of thumb could be suggested to calculate the appeal period, it should be \"ten days plus two months\" rather than \"two months plus ten days.\" R 18/10concerned the calculation of the two-month time limit underArt. 112a(4) EPC. The relevant decision had been posted on 31 August 2010 and the actual notification occurred on 6 September 2010. According toR. 131(2) EPC, where a procedural step is a notification, the relevant event shall be the receipt of the document notified, unless otherwise provided. According toR. 126(2) EPC, in cases where notification is effected by registered letter such a letter is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day following its posting. Therefore, regardless of the fact that actual notification occurred on 6 September 2010 the time limit ended pursuant toR \nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1\n\nContent: A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending.

Rule 6(3)Art \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1. Content: 1.1 General European patent applications can be filed in any language. However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French and German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing (Rule 6(1)). Although filing in any language is in principle possible, there may be limitations due to the applicable national law for applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority underArt. 75(1)(b). European patent applications can be filed in any language. However, if filed in a language other than an official EPO language (English, French and German), a translation into one of the official languages must be filed within two months of the date of filing (Rule 6(1)). Although filing in any language is in principle possible, there may be limitations due to the applicable national law for applications filed at a central industrial property office or the competent national authority underArt. 75(1)(b).

Filing a European patent application in a single language is not a requirement for according a filing date (Art. 90(3)in conjunction withArt. 14(2)).

Content: 6.8.6 Declaration replacing the translation Alternatively, a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the previous application may be submitted within those same time limits (see alsoF‑VI, 3.4andD‑VII, 2). The declaration may also be made by selecting the appropriate box on the request for grant form (EPO Form 1001). This declaration is only valid if the text of the European patent application as filed is an exact translation of the previous application of which priority is claimed, i.e. with nothing added or omitted. If the European patent application did not contain claims on the filing date (seeA‑II, 4.1), the applicant can file these later (seeA‑III, 15). In such cases, for the declaration to be valid, the description of the European patent application must be an exact translation of the description of the claimed priority, regardless of whether the latter contained claims on its filing date. However, where the European patent application contains claims on its filing date and the previous application did not or contained fewer claims on its filing date, the declaration is not valid. Furthermore, if the European patent application contains more or less text than is contained in the previous application as filed, such a declaration cannot be accepted. Where the declaration cannot be accepted for any of the above reasons, to comply with the requirement for filing a translation, a complete translation must be filed within the set time limit. A declaration's validity is not affected by the simple rearrangement of its various parts (i.e. the claims vs. the description) (e.g. if the claims are presented at the end of the application, whereas in the previous application they are at the beginning) or by the use of a different type of reference sign (e.g. Arabic rather than Roman numerals) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.6\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14.

Translation of the application There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: There are three situations in which a translation of the European patent application will be required: (i)the European patent application was filed according toArt. 14(2)in a non‑EPO language (ii)the European patent application was filed by reference to a previously filed application in a non‑EPO language (Rule 40(3)) (iii)the European divisional application was filed in the same language as the earlier (parent) application on which it is based, where this was not an official EPO language (Rule 36(2)– seeA‑IV, 1.3.3). In all cases, a translation of the application must be filed at the EPO: in cases (i) and (ii) this must occur within two months of the filing date according toRule 6(1)(for type (i)) orRule 40(3)(for type (ii)); in case (iii) it must occur within two months of the divisional application's filing according toRule 36(2). Art. 14(2)Rule 6(1) The EPO will check compliance with this requirement. If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency underRule 58within two months in accordance with the procedure explained inA‑III, 16. Art. 90(3)Rule 57(a) Failure to file the translation on time in response to the invitation underRule 58results in the application being deemed withdrawn according toArt. 14(2). The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1). Further processing is ruled out byRule 135(2)for the above time limits for supplying the translation underRule 40(3),Rule 6(1)andRule 36(2)and for the time limit for rectifying the failure to file the translation underRule 58 \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14\n\nContent: Title: Case Law II, E.1.2.3.

The claims may be filed at the following stages: (a)on the filing date or on the date on which the divisional application is filed (seeA‑II, 4.1.5andA‑IV, 1.2.1) (b)after the filing date, in a timely response to a communication from the EPO indicating their absence underRule 58(seeA‑III, 15) (c)after the filing date, by applicants on their own initiative before the EPO sends a communication according toRule 58(seeA‑III, 15). Consequently, the claims fees must be paid within one month of whichever of the above dates of receipt applies. If the claims fees have not been paid in due time, they may still be validly paid within a non-extendable grace period of one month from notification of a communication underRule 45(2)pointing out the failure to observe the time limit. The applicant cannot waive this communication. If a claims fee is not paid within the grace period, the corresponding claim is deemed abandoned and the applicant is notified accordingly. The applicant cannot waive the communication underRule 112(1)noting the deemed abandonment of claims underRule 45(3). If the claims fees paid are insufficient to cover all the claims incurring fees (i.e. claim 16 onwards), and if when payment was made no indication was given as to which claims were covered by the fees paid, then the applicant is requested to specify which claims incurring fees are covered by the claims fees paid. The Receiving Section notifies the search division of claims that are deemed abandoned. Any claims fee duly paid is refunded only in the case referred to inRule 37(2)(seeA‑II, 3.2, last paragraph) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9\n\nContent: (a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)).

            "Question": " On 25  October 2019, the Spanish University Isabel  II and the company Tomato Matters filed a European patent application in Spanish, accompanied by a translation into English. Tomato Matters employs more than 260 employees.  The University Isabel  II has filed two patent applications with the EPO over the past five years. On 10 October 2024, Tomato Matters transfers its rights to Naranjas Navel , a company which employs 9 members of staff and whose annual turnover is EUR  1 million. Naranjas Navel has never filed any patent applications with the EPO.  In a communication from the EPO under Rule 71(3) EPC dated 10 October 2024, the name of the applicants is given as: Isabe  III (clerical error) and Tomato Matters.  1. What has to be done to obtain a Unitary Patent as soon as possible for Isabel  II and Naranjas Navel? Is it possible to benefit from the compensation scheme?  Please list the necessary steps at minimum cost. You should identify the fees that have to be paid, but you do not need to specify their amounts.  2.

            "Question": " European application EP1 was filed online on 2  September 2024 without claiming priority. You realise today, 10  October 2024, that priority from CN1 filed in Chinese on 31  August 2023 was not claimed.  1. Explain why it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 and what steps must be taken.  2. On the same day, you realise that, despite all due care, you filed the description of another application, instead of the priority application translated into English. It was intended that EP1 should have the same content as CN1.  How can you correct this? What will be the effect on the filing date?  3. What is the consequence with regard to claiming priority from CN1? What action could be taken? ",
            "Answer": "1. EP1 was filed within 12 months of CN1 (31 August 2024, extended to 2 September 2024), so priority can be added. The declaration of priority can be made up to 16 months from earliest priority date: 31 December 2024, extended to 2 January 2025. An applicant wishing to claim priority must file a declaration of priority indicating: i. the date of the previous application ii. the state or WTO member in or for which it was filed iii. the application number 2. The applicant may file of their own volition the correct description within two months of filing (Rule 56a EPC): 2 November 2024, extended to 4 November 2024. Since priority was not claimed on filing, Rule 56a(4) EPC does not apply. The application is re-dated. 3. As the new filing date falls outside the 12-month priority period, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period should also be filed, together with reasons. And the fee should be paid.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the question, let's break down each scenario:\n\n### Scenario 1: Claiming Priority from CN1 Without Prior Declaration\n\n1. **Explanation**: Even though EP1 was filed without claiming priority, it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 because the filing date of CN1 (August 31, 2023) is older than the filing date of EP1 (September 2, 2024). According to the guidelines, the filing date of the \"first application\" must be claimed as a priority, regardless of whether it is the original application or a later filing.\n\n2. **Steps Required**:\n   - File a declaration of priority indicating:\n     - The date of the previous application (CN1)\n     - The state or WTO member in which it was filed\n     - The application number (CN1)\n\n### Scenario 2: Correcting the Description Translation\n\n1. **Explanation**: Although EP1 was filed without claiming priority, the description was not translated into English. This means that the description did not meet the requirements for filing under Rule 56a EPC.\n\n2. **Steps Required**:\n   - Translate the description into English.\n   - Pay the necessary fees for translating the description.\n   - Submit the translated description along with the rest of the application.\n\n### Scenario 3: Consequences of Not Claiming Priority\n\n1. **Consequence**: Since EP1 was not filed with a declaration of priority, it does not benefit from the priority period granted by CN1.\n\n2. **Action Needed**: File a declaration of priority indicating the correct details about CN1, including the date of filing, the state or WTO member, and the application number.\n\n### Summary:\n- **Priority Claim from CN1**: No action needed since the filing date is older.\n- **Correction of Description Translation**: Additional fees and submission of the translated description.\n- **No Priority Claim**: No additional fees required, but the application benefits from the priority period granted by CN1.\n\nThis approach ensures compliance with the rules regarding priority claims and translations, maintaining the integrity of the application throughout the process.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: 1.

Content: 1.5 Multiple priorities and partial priorities \"Multiple priorities may be claimed\" – i.e. a European application may claim rights of priority based on more than one previous application (G 2/98). \"Multiple priorities may be claimed\" – i.e. a European application may claim rights of priority based on more than one previous application (G 2/98). \"Partial priority\" refers to a situation in which only a part of the subject-matter encompassed by a generic \"OR\" claim is entitled to the priority date of a previous application (G 1/15). The previous application may have been filed in or for the same or different states or members of the WTO, but in all cases the earliest application must have been filed not more than 12 months before the date of filing of the European application. Subject-matter of a European application will be accorded the priority date of the earliest priority application which discloses it. If, for instance, the European application describes and claims two embodiments (A and B) of an invention, A being disclosed in a French application and B in a German application, both filed within the preceding 12 months, the priority dates of both the French and German applications may be claimed for the appropriate parts of the European application; embodiment A will have the French priority date and embodiment B the German priority date as effective dates. If embodiments A and B are claimed as alternatives in one claim, these alternatives will likewise have the different priority dates as effective dates. If, on the other hand, a European application is based on one previous application disclosing a feature C and a second previous application disclosing a feature D, neither disclosing the combination of C and D, a claim to that combination will be entitled only to the date of filing of the European application itself. In other words, it is not permitted to \"mosaic\" priority documents.

To the extent the priority claim is invalid, the effective date of the European application is the date of its filing. The previously disclosed subject-matter of the European application is not novel if the still earlier application referred to above was published prior to the effective date of the European application (Art. 54(2)) or if the still earlier application is also a European application which was published on or after the effective date of the European application in question (Art. 54(3)). Art. 87(1) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4\n\nContent: .3.1). If no priority is claimed from this previously filed application, the filing by reference itself does not generate outstanding rights according toArt. 87(4). For example, in the case of national applications GB1 (filed on 1 February 2002, without claiming priority) and GB2 (filed on 2 January 2008, without claiming priority), pertaining to the same subject-matter, a European application EP1 (filed on 2 January 2009) claims priority of GB2 but refers to GB1 for its content according toRule 40(1)(c). If GB1 is withdrawn, abandoned or refused, without being open to public inspection and without having served as a basis for claiming a right of priority, the mere reference to it underRule 40(1)(c)does not amount to an outstanding right within the meaning ofArt. 87(4). Consequently, in this case the priority claim to GB2 has to be considered valid for EP1. Rule 40(1)(c) \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4.1\n\n"

            "Question": " Inventor Mr Tulip, a Dutch national, filed Dutch national patent application NL- 1, which comprises 50 pages and includes 20 claims, all in the Dutch language. The EPO established a search report at the request of the Netherlands Patent Office. Mr Tulip then filed an international patent application WO -1, claiming the priority of, and with the same content (description and claims in Dutch) as, NL- 1.  The international publication of WO -1, with the international search report, comprises 45 pages, including 1 page of bibliographic data. The EPO acted as International Searching Authority. International preliminary examination was requested in time; however, no amendments were made in the international phase. 30 months have elapsed since the date of filing of NL- 1.  Mr Tulip now asks for an indication of the cost of entry into the European phase, i.e. how much he will have to pay in official fees over the next 8 months, if all formal requirements are met but expenses kept to a minimum. This will be his first applicati on with the EPO. Mr Tulip expressly requests that no amendments be made before substantive examination. Please name the fees that need to be paid and state which reductions are available. It is sufficient to indicate how to calculate, but it is not necessary to indicate the amounts nor to provide full calculations. 6. (3 po ints) Third -party observations were filed regarding a patent application. They were sent to the applicant with a communication (Form 2022) dated 22 November 2023.  1. What did the applicant have to do and by what date?  2. The EPO then sent a communication under Art. 94(3) dated 21 December 2023, setting a period of 4 months to respond. It was received by the applicant on 28 December 2023. The applicant requested a first extension of 2 months in time, and this was granted by a communication dated 19 April 2024 and received on 26 April 2024. The applicant wished to request a second time extension. What did the applicant then have to do and by what date? 3. The second request for extension of time was filed on the last possible date but was refused. The applicant was then informed by a noting of loss of rights that the application had been deemed to be withdrawn for failure to file a response in time. Both communications are dated 12 August 2024 and were received on 19 August 2024.  How can this be remedied and by what date?  ",
            "Answer": "Fees to be paid: Filing fee, online filing + ten page fees: 30% micro-entity reduction Fees for five claims (no reduction) Examination fee with the following sequentially combined reductions: 30% micro-entity reduction 30% reduction if the request for examination is filed in Dutch 75% reduction because the EPO acted as IPEA Designation fee: 30% micro-entity reduction Renewal fee for the third year: 30% micro-entity reduction",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To determine the costs associated with entering the European phase for Mr. Tulip's application, we need to consider the additional fee for pages exceeding 35 and the designation fee.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **Additional Fee for Pages Exceeding 35:**\n   - The total number of pages in the application is 50.\n   - The maximum allowed pages are 35 + 1 = 36 (since there is 1 page of bibliography).\n   - Number of extra pages = 50 - 36 = 14.\n   - Additional fee per extra page = €10 (as per the guidelines).\n\n   Therefore, the additional fee = 14 * €10 = €140.\n\n2. **Designation Fee:**\n   - Since the application entered the European phase on or after 1 April 2009, the designation fee applies.\n   - The designations fee should be paid within 31 months of the filing date or the priority date.\n   - As the application is filed on or after 1 April 2009, the deadline is 31 months from the filing date.\n\nSince the exact filing date is not provided, let's assume the filing date is today (let's say March 1, 2024).\n\n3. **Filing Date**: Assume filing date is March 1, 2024.\n\n   - Total time remaining until expiration = 31 months - 1 year (March 1, 2024) = 21 months.\n   - Payment due = 21 months * €10 = €210.\n\nTherefore, the total additional fee and designation fee for Mr. Tulip's application would be €140 (additional fee) + €210 (designation fee) = €350.\n\nThis is the total amount Mr. Tulip needs to pay in official fees over the next 8 months, assuming all formal requirements are met but expenses are kept to a minimum.\nContext: \nExtracted documents:\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2. Content: 13.2 Additional fee (if application documents comprise more than 35 pages) This section relates only to applications filed and international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009 (see also the notice from the EPO dated 26 January 2009,OJ EPO 2009, 118, and its supplement,OJ EPO 2009, 338). This section relates only to applications filed and international applications entering the European phase on or after 1 April 2009 (see also the notice from the EPO dated 26 January 2009,OJ EPO 2009, 118, and its supplement,OJ EPO 2009, 338). EP-direct applications An additional fee is payable as part of the filing fee for European patent applications filed on or after 1 April 2009 and comprising more than 35 pages. The fee amount depends on the number of pages over 35. The language reduction underRule 6(3)applies if the requirements ofRule 6(4),Rule 6(6)andRule 6(7)have been met (seeA‑X, 9.2.1andA‑X, 9.2.2). The additional fee is payable within one month of the application's filing date or of the date of receipt of a European divisional application or a European patent application according toArt. 61(1)(b). If the application is filed without claims or by reference to a previously filed application, the additional fee is payable within one month of filing the first set of claims or the certified copy of the application referred to inRule 40(3), whichever expires later. The additional fee is calculated on the basis of the pages of the description, claims, any drawings and one page for the abstract, in the language of filing. Where formal deficiencies in the documents making up the European patent application need to be corrected, the number of pages complying with the physical requirements (seeA‑III, 3andA‑IX) is taken as the basis for calculation \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5. Content: 11.2.5 Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, the designation fee must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date, if the time limit specified inRule 39(1)has expired earlier. For Euro-PCT applications entering the European phase, the designation fee must be paid within 31 months of the filing or priority date, if the time limit specified inRule 39(1)has expired earlier. Rule 159(1)(d) According toRule 160(1), if the designation fee for the Euro-PCT application entering the European phase is not paid within the basic period underRule 159(1)(d), the European patent application (seeArt. 153(2)) is deemed withdrawn. If the EPO finds that that has occurred, it notifies the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1). In response, the applicant can request further processing according toArt. 121andRule 135.

If the international publication of the Euro-PCT application is in another language, a translation into one of the official languages must be filed with the EPO within 31 months of the priority date (Art. 22(1) PCTandRule 159(1)(a)), seeE‑IX, 2.1.3. The EPO will publish the translation of the application submitted by the applicant upon entry into the European phase. In that case the provisional protection is, subject toArt. 67(2)and(3), only effective as from the date of publication of the translation by the EPO. The international publication of a Euro-PCT application in an official language of the European Patent Office takes the place of publication of the European patent application and will be mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin.

Content: 1.4.1 Filing, search and designation fee(s) The filing fee and search fee for the divisional application must be paid within one month of filing the European patent application. For the additional fee due for any pages in excess of 35, seeA‑III, 13.2. For the additional fee due for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations, seeA‑IV, 1.4.1.1. The designation fee(s) must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application. The filing fee and search fee for the divisional application must be paid within one month of filing the European patent application. For the additional fee due for any pages in excess of 35, seeA‑III, 13.2. For the additional fee due for divisional applications of second or subsequent generations, seeA‑IV, 1.4.1.1. The designation fee(s) must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application. The search fee must be paid even if a further search fee has already been paid underRule 64(1)in respect of the search report on the parent application for the part of the application that was lacking in unity and that is now the subject of the divisional application (for reimbursement of the search fee, seeA‑IV, 1.8). Rule 36(3)andRule 36(4)Art. 79(2) If, within the applicable time limit, the filing, search or designation fees have not been paid, the application is deemed withdrawn. The EPO informs the applicant of these losses of rights in a communication underRule 112(1). The applicant can request further processing according toArt \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.1\n\nContent: Title: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1. Content: 4.1 Accelerated search For European patent applications filed on or after 1 July 2014 (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) the EPO strives to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from the filing date or from expiry of the period underRule 161(2). Hence, no PACE request is needed. For European patent applications filed on or after 1 July 2014 (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) the EPO strives to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from the filing date or from expiry of the period underRule 161(2). Hence, no PACE request is needed. For European patent applications (including PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA) which were filed before 1 July 2014 and which do claim priority (second filings), on receipt of a PACE request the EPO makes every effort to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from receipt of the request. Without prejudice to the above an accelerated search can only start: (i)after receipt of the applicant's response to a communication underRule 62aorRule63, or expiry of the respective time limit; (ii)in all cases: when the application documents on filing are complete enough for the extended search report to be drawn up. That means, in particular, that the accelerated search can only start once the claims, the description, the translations required and, where applicable, the drawings and a sequence listing conforming to the rules for the standardised representation of nucleotide or amino acid sequences have been filed; (iii)for PCT applications entering the European phase where the EPO did not act as (S)ISA: after expiry of the six-month period underRule 161(2), even if acceleration has been requested under the PACE programme \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1\n\n"
