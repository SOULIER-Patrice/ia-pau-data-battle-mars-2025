These include payment of the filing fee (including any additional fees if applicable), filing of translations if necessary, and payment of the search fee where a supplementary European search report is needed.

It does not itself allow for withdrawing and receiving a full designation fee refund.\\nC: The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded - This statement is incorrect because the legal text states that under certain conditions (such as within six months of the publication date), there is a possibility to get a full or partial refund of the designation fee. Therefore, it cannot be said in absolute terms that the designation fee 'can no longer' be refunded.\\nD: Date of the start of substantive examination - According to EPC RFees 11 Article 11(b) and Rule 39, the time limit for withdrawing an application with a view to obtaining a full refund of the examination fee is before the start of substantive examination. For designation fees, there is no such restriction tied directly to the start of substantive examination but rather depends on when the European search report is published and within six months from that date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC RFees 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f9.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html\nSource: EPC RFees 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f11.html"

The Guidelines do not specify that revocation must occur on the exact filing date but rather allow for the revocation as long as sufficient funds are available at the time of receipt or execution.\\n- **Answer B: 17 October 2024** - This is incorrect because it does not provide enough time to revoke the order. By 18 October, the debit order will be executed according to its specified date (execution date).\\n- **Answer C: 18 October 2024** - This is also incorrect as by this date, the debit order has already been executed.\\n- **Answer D: A debit order cannot be revoked in part** - This option is not correct because Rule 51(2) allows for partial revocation of a debit order if sufficient funds are available on the specified dates.\\n\\nTherefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP) would be October 10, 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html"

Specifically, the applicant can:\\n\\n1. **File a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision**: According to Article 108 EPC, a notice of appeal must be filed within two months of notification of the refusal decision, with an additional two months for payment of the fee if not paid initially.\\n\\n2. **File a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor**: Under Article 137 EPC and Rule 139 EPC, applicants can file such a request within two months from the date on which they became aware of the ground giving rise to entitlement. This can be a viable option if there was a justified reason for missing the time limit.\\n\\n3. **File a request for further processing**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided legal texts, this could imply filing an application under Rule 15 EPC regarding the withdrawal or modification of the application, which is typically handled within the framework of re-establishment or appeal procedures but might be considered as part of a broader strategy to address the situation.\\n\\n**Explanation for why B is incorrect**: Option B suggests filing a request for further processing within two months. While this could potentially be relevant in some circumstances, it is not explicitly supported by the provided legal texts and does not cover the specific time limits or procedures outlined for appeal (Option A) and re-establishment of rights (Option C).\\n\\n**Explanation for why D is incorrect**: Option D incorrectly includes all three options as correct, which is misleading since only Options A and C are fully supported by the legal context provided.\\n\\nThus, the most accurate and comprehensive answer is **D**, encompassing both valid strategies to address the situation where the time limit was missed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 8.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_8_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 108, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a108.html"

The text states, 'The third party is not a party to the proceedings.' Option B is incorrect as it claims that third-party observations may not be filed anonymously, whereas the guidelines indicate that they can indeed be filed anonymously: 'Such observations must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based. The person filing them may not be a party to the proceedings before the EPO. Observations may be filed anonymously.' Option C is incorrect because there are no fees or deadlines for presenting such observations as per Article 115 EPC, and the text confirms this by stating, 'There are no fees or deadlines for presenting such observations.' Moreover, it mentions that observations are considered even if they lack a statement of grounds, as long as the basis is clear from the content. Option D is correct according to the Guidelines: Third-party observations can be filed after the publication of a European patent application and must be in an official language of the EPO. The relevant text states: 'Although lack of novelty and/or inventive step are the most common observations, third-party observations may also be directed to clarity (Art. 84), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 83), patentability (Art. 52(2)and Art. 52(3), Art. 53 or Art. 57) and unallowable amendments (Art. 76(1), Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3)).

The exact deadline should be informed and communicated by the ISA's notice.\\n- **Answer C**: This statement is incorrect because the guidelines do not require paying protest fees along with additional search fees under protest (see PCT Rule 40.2(c)). If an applicant pays additional fees under protest, they are invited to pay the protest fee separately within one month from the date of the invitation.\\n- **Answer D**: This statement is incorrect because according to both the Guidelines for Examination and PCT Rule 40, if you fail to pay the required additional search fees within the prescribed time limit, your application will not be deemed withdrawn but rather will be treated as an abandoned case. The application continues to exist and can be pursued further by paying the necessary fees later (see F-V, 3.5).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, B.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_b_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-V, 7.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_v_7_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: PCT Rule 40, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r40.html"

The correct method to obtain and file such a certified copy with the EPO is by requesting the issuing authority, in this case, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office, to prepare and send it directly.\n\nOption A is correct because:\n- The Guidelines explicitly state that priority documents may be filed electronically or in paper form (A-III, 6.7), but they must be certified copies.\n- It specifies that such electronic priority documents are currently being issued by the patent offices of certain countries, including Luxembourg (A-III, 6.7). Therefore, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office can prepare and send a certified copy as required.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\nOption B is incorrect:\n- The Guidelines do not mention using a DAS code to obtain a certified copy from the International Bureau. The International Bureau's role in obtaining documents like this appears limited to handling filings for which it is the receiving office, such as PCT applications (see A-III, 6.7).\n\nOption C is incorrect:\n- While electronic filing of priority documents is allowed using OLFE or Online Filing 2.0, a certified copy must be provided and accepted by the EPO, not merely submitted electronically without certification.\n\nOption D is incorrect:\n- The Guidelines clearly indicate that priority documents cannot be filed with the International Bureau (see A-III, 6.7).

The phrase 'and' does not make sense in this context as it implies two decisions were made when only one is mentioned.\\n\\nOption C is incorrect because Firm C submitted observations under Art. 115 EPC, but did not initiate or participate in the opposition proceedings directly; hence, they do not have the standing to appeal against the decision regarding the maintenance of the patent.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect as it suggests that Firm B withdrew its opposition and the opposition division maintained the patent.

Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: It incorrectly suggests that Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish first, followed by providing a translation into English. According to Rule 6(1), there is no such requirement; he can directly file in any language and provide a translation.\n  \n- **Option B**: This option states \n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "Explanation: The correct answer is B because it correctly states that PCT Direct can be used when the priority application and subsequent international application meet certain conditions regarding language and filing method. Specifically:\\n- The priority application should be an EP (European Patent) application filed in French.\\n- The search on this application has already been conducted by the EPO.\\n- The subsequent international application is filed in English, using Online Filing 2.0.\\n\\nAnswer B is correct according to Rule 15(3)(b) PCT and the description of PCT Direct which specifies that it applies when an EP application (or a similar European patent application) has been searched by the EPO and the subsequent international application is in English or French, as these are official languages for the European Patent Office.\\n\\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\\n- Option A: While this scenario involves both a Belgian national application filed in French and an international application also in French (fulfilling language criteria), it doesn't mention that the latter is filed using ePCT-Filing. The critical factor here would be if the application was filed via a system recognized by the EPO for PCT Direct, which typically does not specify ePCT-Filing as a requirement. Therefore, this scenario might not fully comply with the conditions for PCT Direct.\\n- Option C: This situation describes an international application being filed directly at the EPO in English and then followed by another international application also in English using Online Filing 2.0. However, PCT Direct specifically requires that the priority application be a European patent application or similar, not just any international application. Therefore, this scenario does not meet the primary condition for PCT Direct as defined.\\n- Option D: Although it is generally good practice to include amended claims with a PCT Direct letter when necessary to overcome search objections, it is not an absolute requirement stated in Rule 15(3)(b) PCT or any other part of the provided legal text. Thus, this statement is overly restrictive and thus incorrect as it is not a condition for PCT Direct.\\n\\nIn conclusion, option B accurately describes one of the scenarios where PCT Direct can be applied, making it the correct answer among the given choices.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2022_MOCK_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_5.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, and Rule 109(4)(a) of the Rules of Procedure of the EPO (RPs), a translation into one of the official languages of any state to which unitary effect extends is sufficient when requesting unitary effect. In this case, since Mr Linguist is seeking immediate registration of the unitary effect on 10 October 2024 and has used English as the language of the proceedings, he must provide a translation into an official language of one or more states to which the unitary patent extends.\n\nOption A (Dutch) is incorrect because although the application was originally filed in Dutch, no specific requirement exists for translating back into the original filing language when requesting unitary effect in different languages. The important aspect here is ensuring that it's translated into an official language of a state where protection will be provided under unitary effect.\n\nOption C (an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA) is too broad and not necessarily required, as per Rule 109(4)(a). The requirement is for one or more official languages of the states to which unitary effect extends, rather than all signatory states.\n\nOption D (Spanish) might be an official language of a state where protection will extend, but it cannot be assumed that Spain or any specific country has signed up and implemented the UPCA.
