Therefore, based on the available information and the context of the question, it is most accurate to choose option D, which indicates that none of the listed options apply.\n\n- Option A: Lithuania - It's unclear if Lithuania is a contracting state for the European Patent Convention.\n- Option B: France - The same uncertainty as with Lithuania applies here; France may or may not be a contracting state.\n- Option C: Italy - Again, it's uncertain whether Italy is part of the European Patent Convention.\n\nSince we don't have specific information confirming that any of these countries are indeed contracting states and the question asks about 'directly entering the national phase,' without explicit confirmation, none of them can be confidently chosen. Thus, answer D (None of the above) is correct based on the given context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html"

                    "Answer": "D",
                    "Justification": "Option D (Correct): Payment of the filing fee, the designation fee, and the examination fee is necessary for early entry into the European phase according to Article 23(2) PCT as confirmed by the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 2.1. Option A only paying the filing fee does not cover all requirements; additional fees such as claims fees, examination fee, and potentially renewal fees are also required. Option B adding claims fees to the options in D is unnecessary because there's no indication from Article 23(2) PCT or the Guidelines that claiming more than necessary would be a requirement for early entry into the European phase. Option C including additional fees such as renewal fees for the third year, which are not specified by Article 23(2) PCT, makes this option unnecessarily expansive and incorrect according to the legal context provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_2_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15: The application may be withdrawn if the applicant fails to file a request for examination within the time limit (see B-XI, 2.2). In such cases, the application is deemed withdrawn as of one day before the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. This means that the last point in time for an effective withdrawal of a European patent application is one day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The date of receipt of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC: This refers to the period after which an applicant can request further processing, not the deadline for withdrawing a patent application.\nB. The latest of the date of payment of the fee for grant and publishing and the date of filing of the translations of the claims in the two other official languages of the EPO: These actions are related to the grant phase but do not pertain to the withdrawal process.\nC. Date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin: According to A-III, 15, applications are deemed withdrawn one day before this date.\n\nThe correct answer is D as it accurately reflects the rule that an application can be considered withdrawn up until one day before its official publication date in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "This choice is correct according to the provided legal text from decision G 2/10 and G 2/11, which state that a deficiency in the publication of the mention of grant did not necessarily render the patent ineffective. However, if there are errors in the published patent specification that could affect the clarity or scope of protection, such as omitting an essential part like page 2 of the description, these may need to be corrected within specific limits.\n\nExplanation: The omission of a significant portion of the patent specification (page 2) is serious enough to potentially impact the interpretation and enforceability of the granted patent. While G 2/10 and G 2/11 do not explicitly state that errors in the specification cannot be corrected, they suggest that such corrections should be made as soon as possible to ensure proper functioning of the grant process.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it suggests the error can be corrected at any time, which would imply a lack of urgency or formal procedure for correction.\n- Option D is incorrect because it limits the correction to only when opposition proceedings are pending. Since the question does not specify that there is an ongoing opposition, this option is overly restrictive.\n- Option C correctly identifies that corrections must be made during the opposition period or if opposition proceedings are pending, reflecting the need to ensure the patent’s validity and clarity before such proceedings commence.\n\nThus, Answer C aligns best with the legal principles provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html"

The filing date was on 27 October 2022, so two months later would be 29 December 2022, which is corrected to 31 December. Therefore, you may file page 3 of the description at any time up to 2 January 2023. Options A, C, and D are incorrect: A states that an invitation from the EPO is required, which is not the case; C suggests adding claims already present in the description without filing them initially, which does not align with the rules; and D involves unnecessary re-filing of the application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html"

In this case, since Ms Smith was incorrectly designated as an inventor on the granted patent, the patent proprietor can request that she be deleted from the list of inventors with a written request, even though no opposition proceedings are pending. This is because Rule 60 addresses situations where the designation of the inventor has not been made correctly and provides a mechanism for correction.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: The provided text does not indicate that Ms Smith can be deleted simply by requesting it in writing; there needs to be a basis, such as an error in the initial designation.\n- Option C: There is no requirement stated in Rule 60 or any part of the EPC that Mr Li's consent is needed for correcting the inventor's designation. The patent proprietor has the right to correct the inventorship if it was erroneously designated.\n- Option D: Ms Smith cannot be deleted from being an inventor without a valid reason, such as an error in her designation during the application process; she can only be corrected out of the record through a formal request by the patent proprietor.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html"

As stated in C-II, 1., if a request for examination is filed late, the applicant may file a request for re-establishment of rights under Article 122 and Rule 136, which allows for reinstatement of the application after payment of the prescribed fee.\\n\\nOption C: The time limit for filing the application within the priority period cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment. A late-filed application will not be considered if it exceeds the deadline unless the applicant has a specific grace period or other exceptional circumstance, which is not covered in the provided text.\\n\\nOption D: The time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself would need to be met; therefore, this cannot be missed and subsequently remedied. If there were no such fee paid, it would imply the initial request was not properly made within the given periods as described.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B because it aligns with the text stating that the time limit for requesting examination can be re-established through a specific procedure.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

Greta and Hassan are not required to sign any specific document for the international preliminary examination as per the provisions mentioned in the options. Therefore, statement B is correct.\n\n1. **Why answer A is incorrect:** The International Searching Authority (ISA) can be appointed from among various designated offices including national patent offices. According to Rule 7(1)(b) of the PCT, Greta and Hassan could approach any ISA designated by a contracting state party to the PCT for their application. However, it does not automatically mean that Hassan can act as the ISA without an appointment or designation from the relevant office.\n\n2. **Why answer C is incorrect:** According to Rule 41(2) of the PCT, the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by one of the applicants or a person authorized by them in writing (such as via power of attorney). While it's not specifically mandatory that Hassan signs this document if Greta does, his authorization is necessary. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n3. **Why answer D is incorrect:** According to Rule 68(1) and Rule 73(a) of the PCT, an international application can be withdrawn by any person who has signed the demand for international preliminary examination or a person authorized in writing (such as via power of attorney). Since Hassan could have been appointed as Greta's agent with a power of attorney, he would indeed be capable of acting on her behalf to withdraw the application if she were unable to do so. Thus, D is incorrect.\n\nIn conclusion, answer B correctly identifies that for Hassan to act before the European Patent Office (EPO) in his capacity as an agent, he needs to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

This rule applies specifically when one or more applicants are either residents or nationals of contracting states that have declared their intention to participate under Article 34(2) of the Convention.\n\nOption B is correct because it mentions a firm (principal place of business in Germany, employs 200 people with an annual turnover of EUR 60 million) and a natural person (residents and nationals of German and Dutch nationality respectively), who are likely to be considered as individuals from contracting states that have declared their intention under Article 34(2).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the applicant, although resident in Andorra and a national of Andorra, does not specify any contracting state of which he or she is a national. Only nationalities of the contracting states can claim this reduction.\n\nOption C is also incorrect as it involves an applicant who is both resident in the USA (not a European Patent Convention country) and a national of Belgium (a contracting state). However, the filing language being French does not necessarily affect the residency or nationality criteria for the entitlement to reduced fees under Rule 6 EPC.\n\nOption D similarly does not meet the conditions since an applicant who is both resident in the USA and a national of Switzerland would not be entitled to this reduction unless Switzerland has declared its intention to participate under Article 34(2) of the Convention, which is not stated here.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Rule 3(2) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, where European patent applications are filed in one of the official EPO languages, or after they have been translated into one of them, the description, claims and drawings can only be amended in that official language, which is the language of the proceedings. In this case, Mr. Van Holland has filed his divisional application EP-div in Dutch, making Dutch the language of the proceedings for this application. Since the original application (EP-parent) was filed with a translation into English, and considering Rule 13(2), which states that 'the European patent application as filed constitutes the document referred to in Article 94(3) EPC,' it implies that Mr. Van Holland must comply with the language of the proceedings for his divisional application EP-div. Therefore, if he wishes to continue with the examination process and rectify the deficiency, Mr. Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP-div together with a request for further processing (C). Now, let's address why the other options are incorrect: - **Option A: The deficiency cannot be remedied.** This is incorrect because under EPO rules, deficiencies can often be remedied by submitting the required documents as per the guidelines. - **Option B: Mr Van Holland can remedy the deficiency by filing an English translation of EP-div within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC.** While it is true that a deficiency must be rectified, this statement suggests that there is a specific rule (Rule 112(1)) for communication, which is not mentioned in the provided text. The correct procedure as per the guidelines is to file an English translation together with a request for further processing. - **Option D: Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP-div together with a request for re-establishment of rights.** This option implies that there is a separate procedure called 're-establishment of rights,' which is not the standard remedy for language deficiencies in EPO proceedings as per the provided text and guidelines. In conclusion, Option C correctly identifies the necessary steps to rectify the deficiency according to the legal context given in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is C because it aligns with Rule 128 EPC and Rule 94(1) EPC. According to these rules, if a European patent application has been validated in only two contracting states, the renewal fees for those states are payable separately by the applicant in each state. For the fourth year, the due date for paying the renewal fee is stated as 9 January of the following year (Rule 128(3) EPC). Therefore, the renewal fee can be validly paid until 9 January 2024 at the latest. This timing is consistent with option C. Explanation for why other options are incorrect: - **Option A**: The due date stated in this option is 16 November 2023, which is too early according to Rule 128 EPC. The renewal fee can only be paid centrally when the application is validated in all contracting states or a centralized payment system has been established. - **Option B**: While it correctly mentions that the fee must be paid centrally if validated in only two states (which is not applicable here as per C-II, 3), it incorrectly states the due date as 30 November 2023. This deadline is incorrect and does not align with Rule 128 EPC. - **Option D**: Similar to option B, this choice also suggests that fees must be paid separately in each state but misstates the due date for payment (16 January 2024), which conflicts with the correct due date of 9 January 2024 according to Rule 128 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

                    "Justification": "1. **Explanation for Correct Choice:** According to E-XIII, 4.2 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, when an opposition division decides to maintain a patent in amended form based on specific requests, it must send an interlocutory decision that includes an invitation to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims and provide a formally compliant version of the entire description or any part thereof. In this scenario, since the paragraph with handwritten amendments is part of the description, the patent proprietor will be invited to submit the amended paragraph in a typed form.\\n\\n2. **Explanation Why Other Choices Are Incorrect:**\\n   - **Option A:** This statement is incorrect because it suggests that the fee for publishing a new specification and filing translations of the claims must always be paid even when an appeal has been filed. According to E-XIII, 4.3, if no appeal is filed, these requirements will indeed apply, but during pending appeal proceedings, such obligations may not arise.\\n   - **Option B:** This choice is incorrect because it states that during pending appeal proceedings, the patent proprietor would not be invited to pay the fees or file translations of claims. However, E-XIII, 4.3 explicitly mentions that if an appeal has been filed, the requirements for publication and translations can still apply depending on circumstances.\\n   - **Option D:** This statement is incorrect because it implies that a typed version must be provided only upon request within four months after no appeal is filed. According to E-XIII, 4.2, the requirements are part of the interlocutory decision sent with the decision and do not depend solely on whether an appeal has been filed or not.\\n\\nTherefore, C is the correct answer as it aligns with the Guidelines by stating that the patent proprietor will receive an invitation to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims, and file a formally compliant version of the amended paragraph together with the interlocutory decision.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_5.html"

In this case, applicant P filed an international patent application (PCT-P) on June 20, 2023, claiming priority from European patent application EP-I filed on July 7, 2022. However, he also had a second earlier European application, EP-II, filed on July 3, 2022. The time limit for adding the missing priority claim would have been twelve months from the filing date of EP-II, which is July 3, 2022.

In this case, the original application was filed on March 20, 2020.\n\nOption B states that 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by October 12, 2023 at the latest.' This is correct according to A-IV, 1.4.3 which indicates that if renewal fees have already fallen due when a divisional application is filed, these must also be paid for the divisional application and fall due when it is filed.\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect:\n\nOption C states 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by April 30, 2024 at the latest.' This is incorrect because under A-IV, 1.4.3, if renewal fees are not paid in due time (by four months after filing), they may still be paid within six months of the divisional application's filing date, but with an additional fee of 50% of the renewal fees paid late.\n\nOption D states 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by October 12, 2023 at the latest.' This is also incorrect because it does not align with the legal text which specifies that these fees must be paid within six months of filing with an additional 50% late payment fee. Since October 12, 2023, is outside the six-month period from March 20, 2023 (four months after the parent application's filing date), this option does not reflect the correct timeline for paying renewal fees.\n\nOption A states 'As no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.' This statement is incorrect because merely failing to pay renewal fees does not automatically result in withdrawal of the application. According to A-IV, 1.4.3, failure to pay the renewal fee results in the suspension of processing (A-IV, 1.2.6), but it does not cause automatic withdrawal.\n\nThus, Option B correctly identifies that the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be paid without any additional fee by October 12, 2023 based on the provided legal context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "This answer is correct because under the circumstances described, and considering that a request for early processing has been filed with the CNIPA before expiry of the 31-month time limit, the applicant needs to take several actions as specified:\n\n- Complete and file Form 1200: This form is necessary for entering the European phase.\n- Pay the filing fee: This payment covers the administrative cost associated with the application in the European phase.\n- Pay the search fee: Since the CNIPA has already drawn up a search report, this fee must be paid to acknowledge the examination and review services provided by the Office.\n\nOption B is correct because it includes all these necessary actions without adding unnecessary fees or steps (such as appointing a representative or paying renewal fees).\n\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A**: While completing and filing Form 1200, and paying the filing fee and search fee are essential, this option does not account for the fact that since an early processing request has been filed, there is no need to pay a third-year renewal fee.\n\n- **Option C**: In addition to the necessary actions (completing and filing Form 1200, paying the filing fee, and search fee), appointing a representative is not required according to the information provided. Moreover, it does not address the fact that a request for early processing has been filed, which means no renewal fee is due at this stage.\n\n- **Option D**: This option suggests none of the above statements are correct, but as explained in the analysis of options A and C, there are valid reasons to choose B. Hence, D cannot be correct.\n\nTherefore, the statement that reflects all actions the CN applicant needs to take is 'B. Complete and file Form 1200 and pay the filing fee, the search fee and the renewal fee for the third year' (Option A), but this should exclude the third-year renewal fee since early processing has been requested. The correct answer is B as it encompasses all necessary steps without the unnecessary fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

The applicant must inform the EPO of their intention to withdraw the application within one month from that date. In this case, since the search, filing and designation fees were paid within a month after 6 February 2023 (the date of filing), it means the applicant is in line with the payment timeline.\\n\\nOption B is incorrect because according to E-I, 7, the application can only be withdrawn for the refund of the designation fee before the mention of the publication of the European search report. This option does not specify this condition and therefore is not correct.\\n\\nOption C states that 'The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded.' However, according to E-I, 7, the fee can indeed be refunded if the application meets the specified conditions for withdrawal before the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\\n\\nOption D states 'Date of the start of substantive examination,' which is irrelevant to the specific refund condition mentioned in E-I, 7. The designation fee can only be refunded up until a certain point related to the publication of the European search report and not at any stage during substantive examination.\\n\\nTherefore, Answer C correctly identifies that the designation fee was validly paid and under the provided legal context, it is possible for this fee to be refunded if withdrawn before the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

The Guidelines for Examination explicitly state that this is not the case: 'The person filing them may not be a party to the proceedings before the EPO.'\n\nOption B is incorrect as per the guideline, which mentions that 'Observations may be filed anonymously,' directly contradicting statement B.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while it correctly identifies that observations must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based (Art. 93), it also incorrectly states that an official fee needs to be paid for them to be considered by the examining division, which is not mentioned in the provided text.

However, if you do not comply within that time limit, the application is deemed withdrawn.\n\n- **Why Option A is correct:** The Guidelines state that for a non-compliance with unity of invention, the ISA must issue a communication indicating that the application does not meet the requirements and referring to the requirement to pay additional search fees. You have two months from receipt (25 September 2024) to pay these fees or else your application will be deemed withdrawn.\n\n- **Why Option B is incorrect:** According to E-VII, 12, you must respond to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results within the prescribed time limit. Not responding would lead to the application being deemed withdrawn unless justified under Rule 56(3) or (4).\n\n- **Why Option C is incorrect:** There is no mention of protest fees in the provided guidelines for unity of invention and search fee requirements. Paying additional search fees under protest does not require you to pay a separate protest fee, as per the EPO’s fee regulations.\n\n- **Why Option D is incorrect:** While it is true that if you do not comply with paying the additional search fees within two months from receipt, the application may be deemed withdrawn (as stated in A), this option incorrectly states 'by 25 October 2024' which does not align with the actual time limit of 25 November 2024 as per the guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

The rule states that the applicant has six months from the date of receipt by the International Bureau (IB) in which to provide a certified copy of the earlier application.\n\n- **Option A: Request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO**\n  - This option is correct. The applicant can ask the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (the national office that received the Luxembourg patent application) to prepare and send a certified copy. According to Rule 16(2), this action is allowed as long as it is filed within six months from when the IB received the international application.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Option B: Submit a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau to enable it to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application**\n  - This option is not directly supported by Rule 16(2). The IB does not have the authority to request or obtain copies from national offices. A DAS code allows access to certain databases but does not authorize the International Bureau to request documents from other national intellectual property offices.\n\n- **Option C: File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO**\n  - This option is incorrect because Rule 16(2) requires that the certified copy be filed with the International Bureau, not directly with the EPO. The EPO does not have the authority to prepare or request certified copies from other national offices.\n\n- **Option D: File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau**\n  - While this option is technically correct (as per Rule 16(2)), it is redundant because the applicant can already file for the certified copy directly with the EPO by requesting the national office to send it. The direct action with the national office as described in Option A would be more efficient and aligned with the text provided.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A**, which involves requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

Here's why:\n\n- **Option D**: This choice correctly identifies that during the opposition proceedings, firm B (the opponent) withdrew its opposition. At the end of the proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted. Firm B, having withdrawn its opposition and no longer being a party to the appeal proceedings, would not be entitled to file an appeal against this decision.\n\n**Explanation for Correctness:**\n- The case law mentioned in Q.3.2 states that if an opponent withdraws during the appeal proceedings, it is no longer a party, and the board of appeal may remit the case to the department of first instance for further prosecution (opposition division). However, the decision made by the opposition division at the end of these proceedings would not be appealable by the withdrawing party.\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A**: This statement is incorrect because while firm B could theoretically file an appeal against a revocation decision, it was the opponent that withdrew, making this option irrelevant.\n  \n- **Option B**: The statement here is incomplete ('and firm B are entitled to...'). Even if there were no missing words, it still wouldn't make sense in context as Firm B’s opposition was withdrawn and thus it would not be a party to appeal proceedings.\n  \n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly states that firm C can file an appeal. According to the provided texts, observations under Article 115 EPC are merely comments on the case; they do not give the observer any right of appeal. The appeals should be filed by the patent owner (Firm A) or remaining opponents.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html"

The applicant received the letter on September 21, 2024, which is within the delivery time frame (the date of receipt should not be later than seven days after the date of issue as per Rule 137(6) EPC).
