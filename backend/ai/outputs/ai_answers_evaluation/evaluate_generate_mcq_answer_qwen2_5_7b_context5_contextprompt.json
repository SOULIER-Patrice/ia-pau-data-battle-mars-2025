This rule clearly specifies that the latest point in time for withdrawing an application to obtain a refund of the designation fee is six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- **Option A (Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report)**: This option aligns with Rule 48(1) RPEPO, making it correct.\n- **Option B (Date of mention of the publication of the European search report)**: The designation fee cannot be refunded immediately upon the mention of the publication of the search report; there must be a six-month period for the application to be withdrawn in order to obtain the refund.\n- **Option C (The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded)**: This statement is incorrect because Rule 48(1) RPEPO explicitly allows for the possibility of a refund if certain conditions are met, including withdrawal within six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n- **Option D (Date of the start of substantive examination)**: The designation fee can only be refunded during the period specified by Rule 48(1) RPEPO and not once substantive examination has started. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the correct answer is C because according to Rule 48(1) RPEPO, the applicant must withdraw the application within six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report in order to obtain a refund of the designation fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_10.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html"

This is reflected in options B, C, and D, but not necessarily as incorrect statements on their own.\n\n1. **Option A**: While it's true that a party may file third-party observations under Art. 115(2) EPC, these observations do not automatically make them a party to the proceedings before the EPO, nor is an applicant obliged to respond to them. The board in T 7/07 (2009) explicitly stated that third parties are not parties to opposition proceedings but may file observations under Art. 115(2). This means option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Option B**: Third-party observations must be filed in writing and can, indeed, be filed anonymously as they do not confer any right to participate in the proceedings. T 40/89 (2007) confirmed that an anonymous third party could file observations under Art. 115(2). Thus, this option is correct.\n\n3. **Option C**: Third-party observations must indeed be accompanied by a statement of the grounds on which they are based and should include an official fee to comply with the procedural requirements as stated in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.8. However, it is not explicitly required that these observations be filed as a part of a response or in conjunction with other filings such as appeals, making this option partially correct but not fully accurate compared to the correct answer D.\n\n4. **Option D**: The text from T 7/07 (2009) confirms that third-party observations can be submitted after publication and must comply with Art. 115(2) EPC, including being filed in an official language of the EPO. This is a correct statement based on the legal context.\n\nTherefore, while B and C contain elements of truth, option D encompasses the core requirement for filing third-party observations as described by the case law and guidelines without overstepping into obligations that are not strictly necessary or mandated.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 8.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_8_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_8.html"

A response is required only when the extended European search report (EESR) is issued under Rule 70a. Thus, you do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results.\\n\\nOption A states that you must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024. According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5 and the relevant deadlines under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the time limit for paying additional search fees is typically three months from the date of the communication, unless a different deadline is agreed upon with the ISA. The exact end date depends on the specific circumstances but not necessarily by October 25.\\n\\nOption C suggests that if you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must also pay two protest fees within the time limit. There is no provision in the PCT or EPO guidelines requiring payment of protest fees when paying additional search fees. The term 'under protest' typically refers to a formal objection filed with the ISA but does not imply an additional fee for doing so.\\n\\nOption D claims that if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed withdrawn. According to the PCT and EPO guidelines, failure to comply with a request to pay additional search fees does not automatically lead to withdrawal of the application. The ISA may issue a report or take other actions but cannot simply withdraw an application for non-payment unless explicitly stated in the treaty.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the provided legal texts and context, only option B is correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, B.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_b_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-V, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_v_4_1.html"

Since the priority document is with the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office, not the International Bureau, this option does not apply.\n\n- Option C: Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO (as per Rule 53(2)) would only be applicable if the applicant has access to a digital version and can provide it directly. However, in this case, no certified copy was filed at the time of filing, necessitating that a new request is made for the document from the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\n\n- Option D: Filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau (as per Rule 53(1)(a)(ii)) would not be appropriate because it should be filed with the receiving Office, which is the EPO in this case.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_6.html"

This applies to Firm C's submission, even if it was not directly party to the decision.\n\n- Regarding the options provided:\n    - **Option A**: Incorrect because the opposition division can make decisions that are appealed by any party with standing. However, this option does not address Firm C’s role.\n    - **Option B**: Correct because at the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted, and Firm C is entitled to file an appeal against the decision due to its status as a third-party intervener under Article 115 EPC.\n    - **Option C**: Incorrect because Firm C, being a third party who filed observations and not a respondent or opponent in the proceedings, would not be directly affected by such a decision.\n    - **Option D**: Incorrect for the same reasons as Option A; it does not correctly identify which party is entitled to appeal based on the given context.\n\nThe correct choice (B) acknowledges that Firm C can file an appeal against the opposition division's decision, even though Firm B did not directly participate in the proceedings but had requested revocation.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_3_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Rule 6(1) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, European patent applications can be filed in any language as long as a translation into one of the official languages (English, French or German) is submitted within two months from filing date. In this case, Korhonen filed his application in Finnish and provided an English translation on time. For amendments to be accepted, they must be recorded in accordance with Rule 4(6), which states that amendments to the text of the description or claims must be recorded in the language of proceedings under Art. 14(3). Since the application was filed in Finnish and subsequently translated into English, the language of proceedings is understood as English. Hence, when filing amended claims together with a request for examination, Korhonen can file them in any official EPO language (Option C) provided he then provides an adequate translation into one of the official languages within the required timeframe. Options B and D are incorrect because they do not align with these legal requirements.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 10.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_10_2.html"

                    "Answer": "D",
                    "Justification": "Option D states that PCT Direct is available on condition that amended claims are filed with the PCT Direct letter, in a single PDF document. According to the provided text from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, this requirement is not explicitly mentioned as part of the basic conditions for using PCT Direct. The guidelines do mention other requirements such as filing an informal comments letter and having it signed by the applicant or their representative. Therefore, Option D is not correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, specifically under Rule 3(2), any amendments to a European patent application or European patent must be filed in the language of the proceedings. In this case, the language of the proceedings is English since Mr Linguist used English as the language of the proceedings.\\n\\nThe correct answer, B, states that 'Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends.' This aligns with Rule 3(2) because it requires amendments and requests to be in the language of the proceedings or translated accordingly. Since English is the language of the proceedings, Mr Linguist would need a translation from Dutch into an official language accepted by those 18 states.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A**: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch (the original filing language) is not correct because he already filed in English.\\n- **Option C**: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA is incorrect. The requirement is for the language used by the contracting states to which the unitary effect extends, which are only 18 specific states in this case.\\n- **Option D**: Mr Linguist may provide a translation of the specification into Spanish is incorrect because there's no indication or requirement that allows using any language other than those officially recognized and agreed upon for the proceedings.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_2.html"
