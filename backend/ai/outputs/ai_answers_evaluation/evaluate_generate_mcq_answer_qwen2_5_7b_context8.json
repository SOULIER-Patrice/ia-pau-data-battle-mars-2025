This statement is incorrect because under Rule 75(4) EPC and Rule 76 EPC, applicants have until 8 months after the delivery date (which is 9 December 2022).

This statement is correct according to Rule 76(1) EPC which allows applicants up until the end of the prescribed term, in this case, 8 April 2023, to request an extension.\n\nHence, **Option A** and **Option C** are incorrect based on the legal context provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-X, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_x_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_2_5_1.html"

This rule allows flexibility by not fixing a specific deadline but setting it close to the final stage of examination.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect because:\n- **Option B (Date of publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent):** According to Rule 82(3) EPC, amendments can only be made 'before a national authority'. The date of publication is well after this point and does not allow for any further amendments.\n  \n- **Option C (Date of notification of the decision to grant):** This option would imply that amendments could still be made even after the decision has been notified, which is not possible according to Rule 139(2) EPC. The rule clearly restricts the time frame before the decision's handing over.\n\n- **Option D (Date of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC):** While it might seem plausible that a correction could be requested until this stage, as per Rule 139(2), corrections must be made 'at any time during the proceedings', but not past the decision to grant. Hence, this option is incorrect as it does not specify a close-enough period to the final decision for corrections.\n\nTherefore, only Option A aligns with the legal text provided by EPO guidelines and Rule 139(2) of the EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_2.html"

Option B is incorrect according to Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 1 which states that 'Applicants who wish to seek protection of an invention in Europe may do so by filing a European patent application with the EPO or by filing a PCT international application designating Europe.' This implies that while applicants can file a PCT international application (PCT-A) through the International Bureau of WIPO, they cannot file it directly with the EPO as per the guidelines provided. Option A is incorrect because it suggests Antonia can validly file PCT- A with the International Bureau of WIPO.

The period for payment of these fees extends until 31 August 2023 according to Rule 147(1).

According to Rule 147(1) and (5), such renewal fees can be paid without additional fee until 26 September 2024, meaning that paying them before 31 January 2023 is valid.\n\nStatement I about the fourth-year renewal fee for EP-X being due on 31 August 2022 is correct, but it mentions paying this fee on 28 February 2023 as valid without specifying the additional fee, which makes statement I incomplete and thus incorrect in its current form. Statement II correctly states that both renewal fees can be paid within their respective deadlines with proper timing.\n\nExplanation for other options:\n- Option A: Incorrect because it includes an inaccurate claim about EP-X's fourth-year renewal fee.\n- Option C: Incorrect because both statements are not entirely correct as described above, particularly regarding the payment of the renewal fee for EP-X without mentioning the additional fee.\n- Option D: Incorrect because statement II is indeed correct according to the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

However, since there was a delay of about 4 months before receiving the international search report (10 June 2022), and assuming that delays are accounted for by extending the deadline, we would need to add those 4 months to our calculation.\\n\\nAdding four months to 17 February 2021:\\n- March: 17 days\\n- April: 30 days\\n- May: 31 days\\n- June: 30 days\\n\\nThis adds up to 108 days, which is approximately 4 months (since a month on average has about 30 days).\\n\\nThus, the deadline for filing the demand would be extended to around 25 October 2021. Considering the additional delay due to receiving the report in June and potentially processing time, it can be extended further.\\nGiven that option B states 19 December 2022, this seems reasonable as an extension of the original six-month deadline plus delays.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- Option A: 17 December 2022 is too early in the extended timeline.\\n- Option C: 10 September 2022 does not account for the delay and is too soon after receiving the report on 10 June 2022.\\n- Option D: 12 September 2022 also does not consider the delays appropriately.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4.html"

The provided text does not explicitly list any specific countries, but based on the EPC's terms, none of the listed options (Lithuania, France, Italy) are automatically eligible for direct entry into the national phase unless they are contracting states. \\n\\n- **Option A: Lithuania** - Although Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004 and became a Contracting State to the EPC through EU accession, it is not specifically mentioned as an eligible country. Therefore, without explicit mention or context indicating otherwise, we cannot assume direct entry.\\n- **Option B: France** - France was one of the founding members of the European Patent Organisation and has always been part of the European patent system. However, the text does not provide specific information about which countries are eligible for direct entry into the national phase from an international application filed in 2021.\\n- **Option C: Italy** - Italy is a member of the European Union (EU) since 1957 and became a Contracting State to the EPC through EU accession. Nonetheless, without explicit reference to Italy or other specific countries, we cannot assert that direct entry into the national phase would be available from an international application filed in 2021.\\n- **Option D: None of the above** - Given the lack of specific information about which countries are eligible for direct entry based on the provided text and considering the legal context of the EPC, this is the most appropriate choice. Direct access to a national phase typically depends on whether the country has acceded as a Contracting State.\\n\\nThus, since none of these options (A, B, or C) can be definitively selected based solely on the information provided, the correct answer is D: None of the above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html"

Therefore, option D correctly states these minimal requirements.\n\n- **Option A (Payment of the filing fee):**\n  Option A alone does not cover all necessary components for early entry into the European phase as per Article 23(2) PCT. It omits essential fees like designation and examination fees, which are crucial for processing an application through the PCT route.\n\n- **Option B (Payment of the filing fee and claims fees):**\n  This option includes the filing fee but incorrectly introduces 'claims fees,' which is not a recognized term in Article 23(2) PCT. It does not encompass the examination or designation fees required, making it incomplete.\n\n- **Option C (Payment of the filing fee, the claims fees, the examination fee, the designation fee and the renewal fee for the third year):**\n  Option C includes unnecessary elements such as 'claims fees' and a renewal fee for the third year. Moreover, while it correctly mentions examination and designation fees, it adds an additional element that is not required for early entry into the European phase under Article 23(2) PCT.\n\nThe correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the minimal financial requirements necessary to initiate the process of converting a PCT application into a European patent application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html"

It is not the date by which a withdrawal must be made.\n\n- **Option C**: The date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin marks the end of the application's pendency, as it signifies that the patent was granted and will soon become public knowledge. Thus, this cannot be the last point in time for an effective withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, option D is correct because it aligns with the principle stated in A-IV, 2.3, which states that 'neither the European patent application nor the designation of any contracting state may be withdrawn up to the date on which the EPO resumes the proceedings for grant.'\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_7.html"

Since the error was found in the publication of the patent specification (i.e., after grant), it cannot be corrected under normal circumstances without specific grounds, which do not apply here.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect because there is no basis for allowing corrections only during opposition proceedings.

This statement is incorrect because according to Rule 137(2) EPC and A-III, 6.2.1, the EPO does not issue a formal invitation for correction; instead, it may directly correct the document if necessary or inform you of any issues.\n\nC. Adding claims at any time without paying the appropriate fees can result in loss of priority (Rule 52(3) and A-III, 6.5.2). According to Rule 137 EPC, amendments must be filed within a prescribed period; adding claims would typically require filing as soon as possible after becoming aware of their omission.\n\nD.

According to Article 134 EPC and relevant case law, a request for deletion of an inventor can only be made during or after opposition proceedings have been initiated (or within six months from the date of grant if no opposition is filed). Since there were no oppositions filed against the European patent granted on January 4, 2023, and Ms. Smith was erroneously designated as an inventor, a request to delete her name can only be made by the patent proprietor during or after any pending opposition proceedings.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: This is incorrect because Article 134 EPC and related case law do not allow for deletion of inventors without the proper procedural steps. A formal request must follow specific conditions, which include the initiation of opposition proceedings.\n  \n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly assumes that Mr. Li’s consent is necessary to delete Ms. Smith's name as an inventor. While it would be courteous and possibly advisable, there is no legal requirement for his explicit consent based on the provided information.\n\n- **Option D**: This is incorrect because while the consent of all joint inventors (or their legal successors) might generally be required in other contexts, Article 134 EPC does not explicitly require such consent before initiating a request to delete an inventor. The key factor here is the lack of pending opposition proceedings.\n\nThus, based on the information provided and relevant case law, no action can be taken to delete Ms. Smith as an inventor until there are appropriate proceedings pending.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html"

Option C extends this deadline to 23 October 2023, which exceeds the six-month period and would result in the application being refused or deemed withdrawn.\\n- **Option D**: While it includes all necessary steps (requesting a change of representative and filing an authorisation signed by the applicant), it incorrectly extends the response deadline for the extended European search report to 23 October 2023, which is incorrect as per Rule 161(2) EPC.\\n\\nIn conclusion, **Answer A** correctly addresses all necessary steps to avoid any loss of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html"

According to these rules, if a time limit has been missed (such as the designation fee payment or examination request), an applicant may request re-establishment of their rights.\n\nA: This option is correct because missing the time limit for paying the designation fees can be remedied by filing a request under Article 123(4) EPC and Rule 135(1)(a) EPO Guidelines. The EPO allows for the restoration of rights if there was no intent to breach the deadline, the applicant had sufficient means at their disposal but failed to comply, or the non-compliance was due to force majeure.\n\nB: This option is incorrect because missing the time limit for requesting examination cannot be remedied under Article 123(4) EPC. The requirement for requesting an examination within a specified period after filing is mandatory and no extension can be granted by re-establishment of rights, as per Rule 135(2)(a) EPO Guidelines.\n\nC: This option is incorrect because missing the time limit for filing the application during its priority period cannot be remedied under Article 123(4) EPC. The deadline to claim a priority must be strictly adhered to and no re-establishment of rights can be granted, as per Rule 135(2)(b) EPO Guidelines.\n\nD: This option is the correct choice for missing fees related to re-establishment itself, not other missed time limits within the application process. The fee for requesting re-establishment of rights is a separate payment that needs to be made when filing such a request and can also be subject to its own time limit under Rule 135(2)(c) EPO Guidelines.\n\nHence, only option D (the time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights) pertains directly to a missed deadline related to re-establishment itself. Other deadlines cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights according to the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

In this scenario, Greta has appointed Hassan as her representative; therefore, it is correct that Hassan would need to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta in order for him to act before the EPO on behalf of Greta.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\nA: This statement is incorrect because according to Rule 18(2) of the PCT, only a person who has been appointed as an agent or representative by the applicant (or their successor) can act in any capacity with respect to an international application. Hassan cannot represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority for PCT-G since he is not a European patent attorney and no power of attorney has been provided, which would be required under Rule 18(2).\n\nC: This statement is incorrect according to Rule 64(1)(a) of the PCT. There is no requirement that the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by Greta or Hassan. The rule states that a request can be made by the applicant, their successor in title, or any person appointed as an agent or representative.\n\nD: This statement is incorrect according to Rule 85(1) of the PCT. The rule allows an international application to be withdrawn by the applicant (Greta), a person with authority from the applicant through a power of attorney, or a successor in title. Since Hassan has not been properly appointed as Greta's agent and no power of attorney exists, he does not have the authority to withdraw the application on her behalf.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_8.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html"

Therefore, it does not fit the scenario described in the question.\n\nThus, based on the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8, and considering the specific circumstances provided, Answer A is correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_8.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "The statement in option A, 'The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA,' is correct according to the provided legal text. Here's why:\n\n1. **Option A is Correct:**\n   - The application was filed in Spanish, which is an admissible non-EPO language (as it is one of the official languages of a contracting state).\n   - According to Art. 14(4) and R.6(3)EPC as described in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, documents that have to be filed within a time limit may also be filed in an admissible non-EPO language if the applicant's residence or principal place of business is within the territory of a contracting state having the language in question as an official language.\n   - Mexico is a contracting state where Spanish is one of its official languages, thus allowing for the filing of documents (like translations) in that language.\n   - The EPO can be chosen as the ISA (International Searching Authority), and the USPTO (United States Patent andTrademark Office) can serve as the IPEA (International Preliminary Examining Authority). This is a valid choice based on the applicant's principal place of business being in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\n2. **Option B is Incorrect:**\n   - Choosing the USPTO as ISA would not be allowed since the application was filed with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property and its language (Spanish) requires an EPO as the ISA to comply with Art. 14(4)EPC because Tijuana, Mexico, is within a contracting state that has Spanish as one of its official languages.\n\n3. **Option C is Incorrect:**\n   - The Austrian Patent Office can indeed be chosen as ISA and the EPO as IPEA for an international application filed in German (as it's an admissible non-EPO language), but Tijuana, Mexico, does not meet this requirement since Spanish would need to be used.\n\n4. **Option D is Incorrect:**\n   - The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore cannot be chosen as IPEA because the EPO has been designated as ISA for applications filed in Spanish and it's more appropriate that the EPO also serves as the IPEA due to language compliance, especially since Tijuana, Mexico, is involved.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided legal text, only Option A correctly identifies a valid choice given the applicant's principal place of business being in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html"

The earliest priority date here is 7 July 2022 (EP-I). Thus, the time limit for adding the additional priority claim (from EP-II filed on 3 July 2022) would be until 12 July 2024. Given that the applicant discovered the missing priority claim on 12 October 2023 and considering A-III, 6.5.1 and A-III, 6.5.2 which allow for adding or correcting a priority claim after the request for grant form has been filed, the time limit is still valid until the end of this period. Therefore, Answer B stating that the time limit expires on 7 November 2023 is incorrect as it does not account for the additional year from the discovery date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_5.html"

There is no indication that an extension, payment of a fee, or reestablishment of rights are required in this scenario.\\n\\n2. **Why Option A is Incorrect:**\\n   - No extension was requested by the opponent/respondent, and there's no provision mentioned for automatic extensions when comments are submitted late unless specifically requested (T 169/08, OJ 2009, 453).\\n\\n3. **Why Option B is Incorrect:**\\n   - There is no indication that a fee needs to be paid for further processing; the communication only mentions an opportunity to file comments.\\n\\n4. **Why Option C is Incorrect:**\\n   - The situation does not involve any lapse or surrender of rights, nor is there mention of reestablishment of rights.

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B: The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest. This aligns with Rule 14(4) of the EPC, as per the Guidelines for Examination (section A-IV, 2.2.4), which states that 'the time still to run after the resumption of the proceedings must not be less than two months.' Given that the applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed on October 12, 2023, and considering the minimum period required for payment is at least two months from this date, November 12, 2023, any valid payment by October 31, 2023, fits within this timeframe. \n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because there's no indication that the application would be deemed withdrawn without payment; it only specifies a period of inactivity.\n- **Option C** mentions an additional fee but does not apply as Rule 51(2) requires such a fee only if renewal fees fall due during a period of inactivity (i.e., the stay). Since proceedings are being resumed, this rule is irrelevant. Therefore, payment by April 30, 2024, is unnecessary and later than required.\n- **Option D** suggests paying the renewal fees without any additional fee on or before October 31, 2023, which aligns with Rule 14(4) but is overly specific in terms of timing. Option B correctly specifies that payment by this date is valid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_2_4.html"

For entry into the EP (European Phase) of a Euro-PCT application, the applicant must file Form 1200 and pay the required fees.\\n\\nIn this specific scenario, the CN (China National Intellectual Property Administration) applicant is requesting early processing under Rule 56(2) PCT as the two-month period has expired. Since the application is now entering the EP phase after 25 months from the filing date and no priority was claimed, the actions needed by the CN applicant are:\\n\\n1. Complete and file Form 1200.\\n2. Pay the filing fee.\\n3. Pay the search fee.\\n\\nThese steps correspond to option A.\\n\\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option B:** The third-year renewal fee is not required at this stage since no priority was claimed, meaning the application entered the national phase after 18 months and is currently in its first year. The third-year renewal fee would be due only when the application reaches its second anniversary.\\n- **Option C:** Appointing a representative (Form 2034) may be necessary later for prosecution purposes but is not required upon entry into the EP phase as per the information provided, unless specifically mandated by national legislation or explicitly requested.\\n- **Option D:** This option suggests that none of the above statements are correct. However, Option A accurately reflects the necessary actions based on the given scenario.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Complete and file Form 1200 and pay the filing fee and the search fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 3.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_3_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html"

However, if the applicant wishes to obtain a refund of the designation fee after it has been validly paid, they would need to withdraw the application before the designation fee becomes due. Since the European patent application was filed on 6 February 2023, and assuming the search report was published within that month with the fees already being paid, the applicant can no longer obtain a refund of the designation fee once it has been validly paid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the six-month period mentioned applies to paying the fee, not withdrawing an application for a refund. \n\nOption B is incorrect as the mention date of publication of the European search report signifies when the fee becomes due and cannot be used for withdrawal purposes if the applicant wishes to get a refund. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the date of the start of substantive examination does not have any bearing on the ability to withdraw an application for a refund, especially after the designation fee has been validly paid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_2.html"

This conclusion is based on the fact that a debit order can only be revoked before it has been executed by CFP. According to the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 7.1.1:\n\n- The essential condition for a valid payment via deposit account is that the debit order must clearly specify the purpose of payment and authorise the EPO to debit the fee.\n- Additionally, it states that CFP can only debit the full amount of the fee if there are sufficient funds in the deposit account.\n\nIn this scenario, the debit order specifies that the renewal fee should be debited on 18 October 2024. Therefore, the applicant must revoke the order before it is executed by CFP to avoid any unintended deductions.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **A. 10 October 2024**: The applicant cannot revoke an order after it has been specified in a debit order and has not yet executed.\n- **C. 18 October 2024**: By the time of execution, CFP will have already debited the renewal fee from the account if no revocation is received before this date.\n- **D. A debit order cannot be revoked in part**: This statement is incorrect as the Guidelines do provide a mechanism for partial revocation or adjustment of payments through timely notification to CFP.\n\nThus, the applicant must act on 17 October 2024 at the latest to avoid the renewal fee being debited from their deposit account.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 11.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_11_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 7.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_7_1_1.html"

However, it also states explicitly that re-establishment of rights in respect of unobserved time limits is not possible for an opponent.\n- **Rule 60** concerns the subsequent designation of the inventor and its deadlines. If the applicant misses the designated period to file the designation after receiving a communication under Rule 60, they can still appeal against the decision to refuse the European patent application.\n\nOption A is correct because:\n- The refusal of the European patent application due to non-compliance with the time limit for filing the designation of inventor falls within the jurisdiction of filing an appeal. The applicant has the right to file a notice of appeal under Article 108 EPC, which allows them to challenge the decision within four months of notification.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option B (File a request for further processing)**: There is no provision in the provided text or standard practice that would allow an applicant to seek further processing after the expiry of the time limit has been missed and a refusal decision has already been made. The EPO’s guidelines do not provide such mechanisms.\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor)**: According to Article 99(1) and Rule 60, there is no mechanism provided by the EPO that allows for re-establishment of rights in respect of unobserved time limits after expiry. This is specifically stated as being impossible (see also E-VIII, 3.1.2).\n- **Option D (A, B and C are correct)**: Since options B and C are incorrect, this combination cannot be valid.\n\nTherefore, the only appropriate remedy for the situation described in the question is to file a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision (Answer A).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html"

Answer C isn't fully supported by the provided text regarding fees and grounds of the statement.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, if a lack of unity of invention comes to light during a supplementary European search following an international (PCT) search, the applicant will be invited to pay additional search fees for each invention other than the one first mentioned in the claims. Failure by the applicant to comply with this invitation results in the application being deemed withdrawn under Article 124(2). Thus, if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn.\n\n- **Why B is incorrect:** The Guidelines clearly state that together with the partial search report, a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims will be provided. This opinion includes reasons for non-unity findings. Hence, it would not be correct to say you do not need to file any response to this provisional opinion.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect:** The Guidelines do not mention anything about protesting the search fees or paying protest fees if one pays under protest. Therefore, option C is incorrect based on the provided legal text.\n\n- **Why A is incorrect:** While it's true that you must pay within a specified time limit, the exact date would be two months from the receipt of the communication (25 September 2024). However, this does not affect whether payment is necessary or if non-payment results in deemed withdrawal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html"

Since the document was filed on September 10, 2024, this would fall under that scenario. Therefore, the correct action to take in this case is to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LUX-PIB) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option B**: Submitting a valid DAS code to the International Bureau would be incorrect because the EPO, not the International Bureau, is in charge of obtaining documents from national offices. The International Bureau typically deals with PCT applications and their handling.\n- **Option C**: Filing an electronic certified copy directly with the EPO is also incorrect as per Rule 19(4). The document must be obtained from the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LUX-PIB) and then submitted to the EPO. Direct submission via electronic means would not fulfill this requirement.\n- **Option D**: Filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau is incorrect because, as stated above, the EPO handles such requests directly from national offices like LUX-PIB.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_5.html"

In this case, the mention of the grant of EP-X was published on 2 October 2024. Since unitary effect had been registered for EP-X-C0 on the same day (10 October 2024), the unitary effect came into existence with respect to the entire European patent application EP-X.\\n\\nAs a result, when unitary effect is granted, all national units are treated as if they were one. Therefore, only one renewal fee needs to be paid for the European patent as a whole. According to Rule 106(2) of the Rules for the Examination of Patents (REFP), 'the 5th year runs from the date on which the European patent was granted.' Thus, the first renewal fee is due in October 2025 for EP-X-C0.\\n\\n- **Option A** is incorrect because it states that a renewal fee still has to be paid by 31 October 2024 for the 5th year. However, according to Rule 106(2), the first renewal fee period starts from the grant date.\\n\\n- **Option C** is also incorrect as it suggests paying a renewal fee on 31 October 2024 for the 6th year, which is not applicable until October 2025.\\n\\n- **Option D** states that no renewal fee has to be paid by 31 October 2024. This would be incorrect because, as per Rule 106(2), a renewal fee is due in the month following the grant date for the first year of protection, which is October 2025.\\n\\nTherefore, since unitary effect has been registered on 10 October 2024 and comes into existence from that day, the correct statement is B: A renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year for EP-X-C0.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

The requirement is to provide a translation into any official language of one or more member states to which the unitary effect extends.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html"
