However, when requesting unitary effect from the European Patent Office (EPO), the applicant must provide translations into the official languages of the countries where unitary effect is requested. Since Mr Linguist's request for unitary effect extends to an unspecified number of states, we need to consider which official language(s) would be relevant.\n\nOption B correctly states that Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends. This is because the UPCA requires translations in the official languages of at least one member state, and since there are 18 states party to the agreement, this condition applies.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: The requirement for a Dutch translation would only be necessary if Mr Linguist had originally filed the application in English and requested that it be treated as such. Since he has already filed the application in Dutch, there is no need for an additional Dutch translation.\n\n- **Option C**: The 24 states mentioned refer to all member states of the UPCA, which includes both the original EU member states (18) plus other countries like Norway and Switzerland. This is broader than necessary because Mr Linguist only needs translations into the official languages of the states where unitary effect is being requested.\n\n- **Option D**: While Spanish might be an official language in some of the 18 states, it does not have a specific legal requirement for translation into this particular language under Article 71(2) of the UPCA. The language(s) must correspond to the member states where unitary effect is sought.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement according to the provided legal text is that Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"
