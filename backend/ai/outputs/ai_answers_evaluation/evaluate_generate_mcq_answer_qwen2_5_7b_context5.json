Thus, statement A is correct.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **B**: This option suggests that after entering the European phase with a French application, an English divisional application can be validly filed. According to the guidelines, documents making up the European patent application can only be amended or filed in a wrong language on the occasion of its amendment (A-VII, 5).

The correct requirements for international patent application PCT-1 are as follows:\\n\\nD. Payment of the filing fee, the designation fee and the examination fee\\n\\nThis choice is correct because:\\n- For an international application that entered the European phase after 1 July 2014 (which includes PCT applications where the EPO did not act as ISA), the applicant must pay certain fees to effect early entry into the European phase. The relevant fees are: \\n  - Filing fee for entering the European phase\\n  - Designation fee (for designating one or more countries of the EPC)\\n  - Examination fee\\n\\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\\n\\nB. Payment of the filing fee and claims fees - Incorrect because, in addition to the filing fee, the designation and examination fees must also be paid.\\nC. Payment of the filing fee, the claims fees, the examination fee, the designation fee and the renewal fee for the third year - Incorrect because:\\n  - There are no claims fees required for entering the European phase.\\n  - The renewal fee is not necessary at this stage; it would only apply later when the application enters the national phases in individual countries.\\n\\nA. Payment of the filing fee - Incorrect because, while a filing fee must be paid to enter the European phase, it cannot stand alone as per Article 23(2) PCT and the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, which specify that additional fees are required.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

According to the provided guidelines, this communication signifies that the application does not meet the requirements of the European Patent Convention and refers to deemed withdrawal under Article 94(4). Therefore, any withdrawal must be made before this communication is issued.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nB. **The latest of the date of payment of the fee for grant and publishing and the date of filing of the translations of the claims in the two other official languages of the EPO**: This option refers to the deadlines related to the grant process, specifically payment of fees and submission of translations. These are not relevant for the effective withdrawal of a patent application but rather pertain to the procedural steps needed after an application is deemed acceptable.\n\nC. **Date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin**: This option refers to the final step when a patent has been granted and published, which happens long after the application process. It marks the point where the patent holder's rights are formally established, making it too late for effective withdrawal as the granting process is completed.\n\nD. **One day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin**: Similar to option C, this is also a post-grant event and thus not applicable to the period during which an application can be effectively withdrawn.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "According to the legal text in the **Case Law IV** example, 'deficiencies in the publication of the mention of grant in the European Patent Bulletin did not necessarily render the decision to grant within the meaning of Art. 97(4) EPC ineffective.' This indicates that the error in publishing the patent specification, such as omitting a page, while it may be undesirable, does not automatically invalidate the granted patent or prevent corrections.\\n\\nOption A is incorrect because the legal text suggests that errors can indeed be corrected; they do not necessarily render the grant invalid.\\n\\nOption B is too absolute and without context from the EPC, it would be improper to state that an error could be corrected 'at any time.' The circumstances of opposition proceedings need to be considered.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect because the legal text does not specify that corrections are only possible when opposition proceedings are pending. As per the case law, the correction can potentially be made even if no opposition has been filed or during the opposition period.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: This error in the published specification of this European patent may not be corrected during the opposition period or if opposition proceedings are pending. The error could still be addressed at other times provided it does not invalidate the grant under EPC provisions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.5.2, if a document is missing from an application and the omission can be corrected by filing the missing parts within two months of the filing date without affecting the priority date or causing the application to lose its filing date (see A-III, 6.1), then you should file these missing parts promptly. Therefore, option B is correct as it aligns with the guidelines stating that you can file the missing page 3 and claims 7-12 within two months of 3 November 2022 without needing to redate the application.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A: The EPO will not necessarily invite you to correct the omission; it is up to the applicant to notice the mistake and file the missing parts. There's no automatic process that requires an invitation from the EPO (A-III, 6.5.2).\n\nOption C: According to Art.123(3) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), adding claims if they are not present in the description can lead to re-dating or rejection of the application unless the subject-matter is already disclosed and claimed before (A-III, 6.5.3). Since no information is provided that claims 7-12 were previously included, assuming this is a new addition might result in issues.\n\nOption D: Refiling EP-A while claiming priority from FR-A would involve additional costs and could lead to inconsistencies between the applications if not handled properly. It's also unnecessary given that you can simply correct the existing application without needing to withdraw and refile it (A-III, 6.5.2).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html"

This is because Rule 60(2) states that 'Where, in a divisional application or a new application under Article 61, paragraph 1(b), the designation of the inventor has not been made in accordance with Rule 19, the European Patent Office shall invite the applicant to make the designation within a period to be specified.'\n\nThe patent was granted on January 4, 2023. By October 12, 2023 (seven months after grant), it is reasonable that the patent proprietor may request the deletion of Ms Smith's name as an inventor since the period for designating or correcting this information has likely passed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text does not specify that a simple written request by the patent proprietor is enough to delete an inventor; there might be other procedural steps needed.\nOption C is incorrect because Rule 60(1) does not mention requiring consent from another named inventor for making such corrections. The correction can generally be made based on the patent proprietor's request.\nOption D is incorrect as well, because under Rule 60, no specific consent of Ms Smith (or in this case Mr Li since he would be the sole inventor after her removal) is required to correct or remove an erroneous designation.\n\nHence, the patent proprietor can request that Ms Smith be deleted as an inventor without needing any additional consent from another named inventor.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html"

Representative Y must first request a change of representative, file a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest, and then ensure that an authorisation signed by the applicant is filed in good time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it omits the requirement for Y to obtain authorization from the applicant which must be signed in good time. The text under 'C-IV 9.1' of A-I states: 'An appointment or change of representative must be accompanied by a power of attorney, unless specified otherwise.'\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect because they specify the deadline as 23 October 2023 instead of 12 October 2023 at the latest for filing the response to the extended European search report. According to Rule 45(1)(a) EPC, a reply must be filed within two months from the date of publication or extension of the European search report, which is 6 April 2023 + 8 months = 12 October 2023.\n\nThus, option A correctly identifies the necessary actions and their deadlines to validly appoint new representative Y without causing a loss of rights for application EP-A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, Art. 122 and Rule 136 specifically address the re-establishment of rights for missed time limits. In particular, Rule 135(2) explicitly states that further processing is ruled out after certain decisions are made by the European Patent Office (EPO), such as when an application is deemed withdrawn due to a missed examination request deadline.\n\n- **Option A**: The designation fee payment can indeed be remedied through re-establishment of rights. However, this option involves a different context and mechanism not specifically mentioned for time limits in examination.\n- **Option B**: The time limit for requesting examination cannot be remedied by re-establishment because Rule 70(1) explicitly states that the request for examination may not be withdrawn after it is filed. Therefore, it would be incorrect to attempt re-establishment of this right if missed.\n- **Option C**: Filing an application within a priority period is typically covered under Art. 81 and Rule 42, which deal with the filing date and priority claims. While there are mechanisms for correcting such errors (e.g., by claiming a delayed priority), these do not involve re-establishment of rights as per Rule 136.\n- **Option D**: The time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights is not mentioned in this context, making it an incorrect choice. The re-establishment itself is the process that might be invoked to remedy a missed deadline.\n\nThe correct answer is B because requesting examination after the initial six-month period cannot be corrected by re-establishment procedures; it must either be done within the prescribed timeframe or the application can be withdrawn and then possibly further processed through Art. 121, but this does not involve re-establishment of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

The ISA role is typically performed by the designated national patent offices or organizations appointed under the PCT, not necessarily requiring an agent's power of attorney. Option A could be correct since Greta appointed Hassan to represent her and he can act before the DPMA in Germany; however, his ability to represent her at the EPO as ISA is not a direct requirement from the provided text. Option C is correct according to Rule 64(1) of the PCT, which mandates that the demand for international preliminary examination be signed either by the applicant (in this case, Greta) or their representative. Since Hassan can act on behalf of Greta within Germany, he can sign such a request. Option D is also correct according to Rule 65(1)(a) and (b) of the PCT, which states that an international application can be withdrawn by either the applicant (Greta in this case) or their appointed representative (Hassan).

The German firm employs 200 people with an annual turnover of EUR 60 million, the applicant (the firm) may be eligible for reduced filing fees as it meets the criteria for small entities under Rule 6 EPC.\\n\\nOption A is incorrect because the nationality and residency do not align properly to qualify for a reduction; there is no specific rule that directly links Andorran nationality or residency with entitlement to a reduced fee based on the given context.\\n\\nOption C is also incorrect as a natural person resident in the USA but of Belgian nationality would not be eligible for a reduced fee, since US residents are typically classified under Rule 7 EPC as non-residents, and thus do not qualify for reductions.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect because a natural person resident in the USA (regardless of Swiss nationality) does not qualify for reduced fees based on their residence status.\\n\\nTherefore, B is correct due to the firm's employment size and turnover meeting the criteria for small entities as specified in Rule 6 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html"

Since Mr Van Holland requested examination in Dutch for his divisional application EP -div but has not filed an English translation as required, this deficiency must be remedied.\\n\\nFurthermore, Rule 3(2) of the EPC states that any amendments to the application need to be made in the language of the proceedings (here, Dutch). However, the requirement for a translation into one of the official languages (English, French, or German) is an additional requirement. Therefore, Mr Van Holland needs to file both an English translation and make a request for further processing as specified under Rule 40(3).\\n\\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that the deficiency cannot be remedied at all, which contradicts the legal requirement of filing the necessary translations.\\n\\nOptions B and D are incorrect:\\n- Option B incorrectly suggests that Mr Van Holland can remedy the deficiency by simply filing an English translation within two months of receiving a communication under Rule 112(1) EPC. This is not correct because he must also request further processing.\\n- Option D incorrectly suggests requesting re-establishment of rights, which is related to situations where there has been a lapse in payment and does not apply here since Mr Van Holland has paid all due fees.\\n\\nThus, the correct procedure involves filing an English translation together with a formal request for further processing.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html"

This applies even if no appeal is filed. Therefore, option B is correct because it states that these steps are required in the absence of an appeal.\n\n**Why Option A is Incorrect:**\nOption A incorrectly suggests that payment for publishing a new specification and other formalities must be requested by the patent proprietor.

It does not fit the scenario where there were WO-ISA and Article 19 PCT amendments.\n\n- **Option C**: Form 1226CC is related to situations where the applicant requests an extension of time to file objections or pay additional fees, which does not match the situation given in the question.\n\n- **Option D**: Form 1226AC would indicate that examination has officially started. However, this form is issued after a more formal response from the applicant regarding any necessary amendments following the WO-ISA, and since there were no further filings on entry into the regional phase, it would not be appropriate in this case.\n\nTherefore, Form 1226BB offering the opportunity to comment and file amendments (Answer B) is the correct communication expected after receipt of a negative written opinion with Article 19 PCT amendments filed during the international phase. \n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_2.html"

However, it omits the payment of fees beyond just the filing fee and search fee.\n  \n- **Option B** includes paying the renewal fee for the third year, which is not required at this stage (25 months after the filing date). The renewal fee would only be due later, specifically 31 months after the priority date (or filing date if no priority is claimed).\n\n- **Option C** mentions appointing a representative. While appointing a representative can be important for many applicants, it's not an absolute requirement when entering the European phase based on the provided information.\n\nThe correct answer is D because:\n\n1. An international application that has been published 25 months after filing (18 months + 7 months) and no more than 35 pages/claims is in a position where early processing can be requested under Art. 23(2) PCT. The applicant needs to file Form 1200, which includes the required information for entering the European phase.\n\n2. The filing fee and search fee are necessary as they are part of the basic fees associated with the international application being published in this time frame.\n   \n3. Renewal fees (option B) would be due at a later stage after 31 months from the priority date or filing date, which is not applicable here.\n\n4. Appointing a representative (Option C) might be advisable for some applicants but isn't universally required based on the context provided by the guidelines and the specific timeframe of entry into the European phase.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

The provided text mentions that 'The latest point at which a decision on grant or withdrawal may be taken without affecting the right to refund the designation fee is six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report,' indicating that six months from this date is the latest time for withdrawing an application and obtaining a refund of the designation fee. \n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A: 'Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report' - This option correctly identifies the period within which withdrawal can be made to obtain a refund, but it is not the latest point in time for withdrawing an application; instead, it is part of the condition that must be met to qualify for the refund.\n\nOption B: 'Date of mention of the publication of the European search report' - The text indicates that if the application is withdrawn after this date and before six months have passed from this date, a refund may still be obtained. Therefore, this option does not specify the latest point in time.\n\nOption D: 'Date of the start of substantive examination' - This would likely occur well past the six-month period mentioned for withdrawal to obtain a refund. The text provides a specific timeframe for withdrawing an application and obtaining a refund based on the date of publication of the European search report, not the commencement of substantive examination.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6.3, a debit order can be revoked at any time before execution by the fee office (see A-IV, 6.3). The latest point in time for revoking the renewal fee would thus be just before its scheduled execution on 18 October 2024.\n\n### Why Other Options are Incorrect:\n\n**A. 10 October 2024**\n- This option is incorrect because a partial revocation of a debit order can only occur before it has been executed by the fee office, not immediately after filing.\n\n**C. 18 October 2024**\n- This option is incorrect because by this date, the execution of the debit order would have already taken place or at least be imminent. The fee for the third year should not have been debited if the revocation was successful before the execution.\n\n**D. A debit order cannot be revoked in part**\n- This statement is also incorrect as per the guidelines mentioned above (A-IV, 6.3). Debit orders can indeed be partially revoked before they are executed by the fee office.\n\nIn conclusion, the applicant has until just before the scheduled execution of the debit order on 18 October 2024 to revoke the renewal fee for the third year from being debited.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

Thus, this option is incorrect based on the context provided.\\n- Option C: The applicant can file a request for re-establishment of rights within two months of notification of the decision according to Article 122(3) EPC and Rule 136(1). This allows the applicant to address missed time limits, such as the failure to file the designation of inventor on time.

The time limit for replying can be extended by three months upon request if justified. In this case, the communication was dated September 25, 2024, and the time limit would thus end on December 26, 2024 (assuming no extension is requested). Since additional search fees are required, they must be paid within the same time frame. Therefore, paying two additional search fees by October 25, 2024, would still fall within this period.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **Option B**: According to Rule 71(3) of the Rules for the Handling of Proceedings Before the EPO (RHP), you are required to file a response addressing the ISA's communication. The ISA is inviting you to pay additional search fees, which means that there are deficiencies in your application as it stands now. Ignoring this request would be non-compliant with procedural requirements.\n  \n- **Option C**: Rule 71(4) states that if you proceed under protest by paying the required fee, you must also file a protest within one month of payment. This does not mean that you need to pay additional protest fees; it only refers to filing a formal protest with the EPO. Hence, this statement is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D**: According to Rule 43(2) of the Examination Guidelines, if you fail to comply with the communication from the ISA within the time limit (and extensions), your application will be deemed withdrawn under Art. 19(6)(a) of the EPC. However, this would only occur after the deadline for compliance has passed and not because you have not paid additional fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

This is the appropriate course of action as it aligns with the guidelines provided.\n\nOption B: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau would be incorrect because the EPO does not have direct access to databases outside its jurisdiction without specific authorizations or codes, and the Luxembourg office has its own procedures for issuing certified copies. The DAS code is used by the EPO to gain access to documents stored in the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) system, which would not be applicable here.\n\nOption C: Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO is incorrect because the guidelines do not mention filing an electronic version directly with the EPO. The requirement for a certified copy typically involves having it prepared by the national office and sent to the EPO.\n\nOption D: While this might seem plausible, filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau (WIPO) is not correct because the responsibility for issuing certified copies lies with the receiving Office (in this case, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office). The International Bureau is part of WIPO and primarily deals with international applications, whereas the national office in Luxembourg will handle the request for a certified copy specific to that jurisdiction.\n\nThus, option A is the most appropriate action as it follows the procedures outlined in the guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

In this scenario, the parent application's filing date is October 2019, and therefore, the renewal fee for the fifth year would be due on 31 October 2024. \n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because it refers to a fee still having to be paid in respect of the 5th year. The unitary effect was registered on the same date as the publication of grant, which means that all obligations related to the divisional application are considered from this date onwards.\n  \n- **Option C** suggests a renewal fee for the sixth year, which is incorrect based on the provided text and context since the fees are due annually starting from the third year after the filing date.\n\n- **Option D** states no renewal fee has to be paid, but it contradicts the legal requirements where renewal fees must still be paid in respect of the fifth year as per the terms of the EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Rule 71(2) of the Rules of Procedure for Examination in the European Patent Office (RPEPO), as referenced in E-XIII, 4.3 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, a translation into any one official language of any state party to the unitary patent framework is sufficient for obtaining immediate registration of the unitary effect. Since Spain is not explicitly mentioned as one of the states that have signed the Unitary Patent Package Agreement (UPCA), we need to consider only the 18 states that are parties to the UPCA, which means option B is correct.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: According to Rule 71(2) and E-XIII, 4.3 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, Mr Linguist does not have to provide a translation into Dutch because it's not one of the official languages of any state party to the UPCA.\n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly suggests that all 24 states must be considered, which is not necessary based on Rule 71(2) and E-XIII, 4.3. The relevant states are only those that have signed the UPCA (i.e., 18 states).\n- **Option D**: Similarly to Option C, this choice incorrectly suggests a broader scope than what is required. Since Spain has not signed the UPCA, it does not qualify as an official language of any state party for the purpose of immediate registration under Rule 71(2).\n\nThus, Mr Linguist must provide a translation into one of the official languages of the 18 states that are parties to the UPCA, making Option B the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"
