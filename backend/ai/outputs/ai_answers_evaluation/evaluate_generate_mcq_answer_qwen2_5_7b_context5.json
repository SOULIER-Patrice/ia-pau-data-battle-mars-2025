This aligns with Rule 35(1) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), which mandates that to enter the EP phase, an applicant must complete and submit form 1200 along with payment of the appropriate fees, including the filing fee and the search fee. Since a request for early processing has already been filed, this action is necessary to proceed.\n\nOption B suggests paying the 'renewal fee for the third year,' which is not required as per Rule 35(1) of the EPC. The renewal fees are typically associated with maintaining a patent after it has been granted, but since we're in the process of entering the EP phase, these fees do not apply yet.\n\nOption C includes 'appointing a representative,' which is unnecessary for simply entering the EP phase as per Rule 35(1). Appointment of a representative would be required if the applicant wishes to engage in further proceedings or amendments but is not part of the initial entry procedure into the EP phase.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

The latest point in time for revoking the order in Central Fee Payment (CFP) would thus be before the specified execution date of the debit order, which is on 18 October 2024.\n\n- **Option A: 10 October 2024** - This is too early to revoke the order as it has not been executed by the bank yet.\n- **Option C: 18 October 2024** - By this time, the order would already have been executed and cannot be revoked anymore.\n- **Option D: A debit order cannot be revoked in part** - This is incorrect because according to the guidelines, a partial revocation of a debit order is possible until it has been executed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: 17 October 2024.

In this case, the applicant missed the deadline for filing a designation of inventor as required by Article 90(3) EPC and Rule 60 EPC. Upon expiry of the time limit, the Receiving Section issued a decision to refuse the European patent application on October 10, 2024.\n\n- Option A: File a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision\n   - This is correct because Article 101(1) EPC and Rule 103 allow an applicant to file a notice of appeal against any decision of the Receiving Section (or Board of Appeals in other cases), including one refusing an application. The time limit for filing such an appeal is four months from notification, as per Rule 104.\n\n- Option B: File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision\n   - This option is incorrect because Article 97(2) EPC and Rule 80(2)(a) specify that only re-establishment of rights can be requested after expiry of a time limit, not further processing.

The period is calculated inclusively until the end of the month following the date of receipt.\n\nIn this case:\n- Date of receipt of the communication: 25 September 2024\n- Due date for paying the additional search fees: 25 November 2024\n\nOption A states 'You must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024,' which is incorrect because the fee should be paid before or on 25 November 2024.\n\n**Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect:**\n\n- **B. You do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results:** According to Rule 48(1)(c) of the RIPPPC, payment of additional fees is linked to the necessity to comply with the unity of invention requirement. Failure to pay the required fees may result in consequences as outlined in Art. 25(3) of the PCT which mandates that failure to remedy deficiencies within a specified period results in the application being considered withdrawn.\n\n- **C. If you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must pay two protest fees within the time limit:** There is no mention or requirement for paying protest fees when paying an additional search fee 'under protest.' The Guidelines do not specify that such a condition exists.\n\n- **D. If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn:** According to Rule 48(1)(c) of the RIPPPC, if an applicant fails to pay the additional search fee by the deadline, the application is considered withdrawn under Article 25(3) of the PCT. However, this statement is overly broad as it does not account for the possibility that the EPO may issue a formal notice and provide further guidance.\n\nThe correct answer is A because paying the additional search fees within the specified time frame (by 25 November 2024) is mandatory to avoid potential withdrawal of the application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

In option B, Firm B (the opponent) is mentioned as having withdrawn its opposition during the appeal proceedings, which means it is no longer a party and thus cannot file an appeal.\n\nOption A: While true in some scenarios, there's no indication in the given question that the opposition division decided to revoke the patent at the end of the proceedings. Therefore, this statement cannot be directly inferred from the information provided.\n\nOption C: Firm C filed observations under Article 115 EPC and did not initiate the opposition; therefore, it is not a party to the opposition proceedings. According to the rules, only the parties who have initiated or supported an opposition can file an appeal against the decision of the opposition division.\n\nOption D: This scenario describes that Firm B withdrew its opposition before the appeal stage was reached. As explained earlier, once a party withdraws their opposition, they are no longer in a position to appeal against the final decision made by the opposition division.\n\nThus, since Firm B is no longer involved due to withdrawal of the opposition and only the parties who initiated or supported the opposition have standing for an appeal, Firm A (the patent proprietor) would not be able to file an appeal as per option D.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html"

In this scenario, EP-X is the European patent application with unitary effect for EP-X-C0 registered on 10 October 2024. The priority date of EP -X is 16 October 2019 (the filing date of the Belgian application), and it was published on 2 October 2024. The first renewal fee for a European patent application due from the third year onward would be payable in respect of the fourth year after the priority date, which is calculated as follows: - Priority date: 16 October 2019 - First renewal fee period (3rd year): 17 October 2022 to 16 October 2023 - Second renewal fee period (4th year - first due payment): 17 October 2023 to 16 October 2024 Since the European patent application EP-X was filed in 2020 and the mention of its grant was published on 2 October 2024, the second renewal fee (for the fourth year) would be due at this time. Therefore, a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 for the fifth year for EP -X-C0. Why Other Options Are Incorrect: - **Option A**: Stating that a renewal fee still has to be paid by 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year for EP-X is incorrect because unitary effect was registered on 10 October 2024, and the first due payment would then fall within the fifth year. - **Option C**: Stating that a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 6th year for EP-X-C0 is incorrect because the second renewal fee (for the fourth year) falls within the period up to 31 October 2024, not the sixth year. - **Option D**: Stating that no renewal fee has to be paid on 31 October 2024 is incorrect for the same reason as Option C; the second renewal fee (for the fourth year) falls within this period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "Option B is not correct because it specifies that the priority application must be an EP (European Patent) application filed in French and subsequently converted to a PCT international application in English. According to Rule 56(1)(a), PCT Direct is only available if the priority application was originally filed at the EPO or with another designated Office. An EP application, which is examined by the EPO but not directly filed there, does not qualify as such a 'priority application' eligible for PCT Direct.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because it mentions a Belgian application being filed in French and subsequently converted to an international application in French. Rule 56(1)(a) specifies that the priority application must have been filed at the EPO or with another designated Office, which does not include applications from countries such as Belgium (unless explicitly stated otherwise for specific bilateral agreements).\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because it mentions filing an international application directly with the EPO in English. PCT Direct specifically requires that the priority application be one that was previously examined by the EPO or another designated Office, and subsequently converted to an international application. It does not cover applications where the initial international filing already took place at the EPO.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because it suggests that amended claims must be filed with the PCT Direct letter for it to be valid. According to Rule 56(3), applicants are required to provide a translation and may also include informal comments, but there is no specific requirement in the text provided or in the standard guidelines for filing amended claims as part of the PCT Direct process.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct answer is B because it incorrectly describes the eligibility requirements for using PCT Direct. The other options are incorrect due to misinterpretations of the application's origin and the specifics required by Rule 56(1)(a).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is Option B: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends. According to Article 70(2) and (3) of the Implementing Regulations of the European Patent Convention, as well as Rule 71(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Boards of Appeal, a translation into one of the official languages of the countries participating in the unitary patent must be provided when requesting unitary effect. The relevant provisions state that documents forming part of the patent application or patent and translations thereof required by the EPO, shall be presented in an official language of any contracting state. Since there are 18 states currently participating in the Unified Patent Court (UPC) as of my last update, a translation into one of these languages is necessary.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n\n- **Option A**: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch.\n   - This option is incorrect because the initial filing language was Dutch. However, for obtaining unitary effect, the translation needs to be in an official language of the participating states (18 as of now), not necessarily the language used in the original application.\n\n- **Option C**: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA.\n   - This option is incorrect because only the 18 states currently participating in the unitary patent system are relevant for this requirement. The number of signatories to the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA) includes additional countries not yet fully participating, hence making Option C broader and not specific enough.\n\n- **Option D**: Mr Linguist may provide a translation of the specification into Spanish.\n   - This option is incorrect because while Spain is one of the 18 states that currently participate in the unitary patent system, it must be an official language of these participating states. Since Spanish is not one of the official languages used by all 18 states, it does not meet the requirement for obtaining unitary effect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"

According to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date. Consequently, the 31-month period expires 31 months from the priority date to be restored. A period of one month is permitted for filing a request for restoration of priority at the EPO under Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT and Article 22 PCT. Merely fulfilling the requirements of Rule 159(1) earlier than 31 months from the priority date will not change this, as the EPO can only start processing the application before the 31-month time limit if this is expressly requested by the applicant. If the applicant requests early processing and complies with the requirements of Rule 159(1), the effective date of early entry will change, and the time limit for requesting restoration of the priority period will be one month from the effective date (Euro-PCT Guide, 15th edition, 2022, 5.13.022 – 5.13.023; Guidelines E-IX, 2.8.)"

It is also too late to restore the priority under Article 122 EPC, which would have had to happen no later than two months after the 12-month time limit set by Article 87 (1) EPC.\nFP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1.\nFP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2.\nThe disclosure of subject-matter A in FP1 takes away the novelty of claim 1 in EP1.\nSubject-matter A+B was disclosed for the first time in FP2, making FP2 the first filing for this subject-matter. The priority claim is therefore valid for A+B. The effective date for claim 2 is before the publication of FP1, so FP1 cannot be cited as prior art against it."

This period is deemed to have been observed if the information is communicated before the completion of technical preparations for the publication. In this scenario, EP-1 was filed on 10 December 2020 without designating an inventor. The designation was submitted on 25 February 2022. To calculate whether the deadline has been met: \\n\\n- Filing date: 10 December 2020\\n- Priority period (if claimed): This needs to be checked, but even if no priority is claimed, the deadline would still be from the filing date.\\n- Deadline: Within sixteen months of 10 December 2020. \\n\\nCalculating the deadline:\\n- From 10 December 2020 to 9 June 2021 (end of the first six months)\\n- Adding another year, i.e., until 8 December 2021\\n- Adding an additional month, which would be up to 9 February 2022 \\n\\nSince the designation was filed on 25 February 2022, it falls within the extended deadline (up to 9 February 2022), thus being made in due time. Option B suggests that the application will be refused because the designation of the inventor was not filed in due time.

The guidelines do not state a blanket prohibition against phrasing claim features as results to be achieved.\n- Option C is incorrect because the introduction of these features, although already present in another claim, could still be seen as introducing ambiguity if they are unclear when introduced into an independent claim.\n\nThe decision on clarity will depend on whether the feature can be clearly understood and applied.

Instead, it has an immediate non-retroactive effect (i.e., patent protection ceases on the date of surrender or lapse), while a revoked patent is deemed to have had no effect from the outset.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nB: This option is incorrect because there can be valid reasons for opponents to oppose a patent that has been surrendered or lapsed. As explained above, the rights conferred by the patent may still subsist until its surrender or lapse and claims arising from those rights might continue to exist after the date of grant.\n\nC: Although this statement about the difference between ex nunc (from the moment it occurs) and ex tunc (from the beginning), which is correct according to Art. 68 EPC, does not directly address why an opposition can be filed post-surrender or lapse.

In this case, the problem with the clarity of claim 2 is a genuine attempt to overcome a ground for opposition, even though it may not have been explicitly invoked by the opponent. The guidelines clarify that any amendments made should genuinely address the grounds for opposition and that the grounds for opposition do not necessarily need to be explicitly cited. Therefore, addressing the clarity issue in claim 2 can be considered a legitimate attempt to overcome the ground for opposition related to clarity. Option B would be incorrect because there is no specific prohibition against amending claims that are not directly addressed by the grounds for opposition, as long as such amendments genuinely attempt to address the issues raised.

Further, in **T 1011/92** and **T 517/97**, it was ruled that an intervener must pay the fee if they want to have their own right to appeal proceedings. However, in **T 144/95**, where an intervention was filed during appeal proceedings and an appeal fee paid, the board ordered the appeal fee to be refunded because the intervener did not satisfy the conditions to file a valid appeal as an appellant.\\n\\nOption B is incorrect because there is no legal basis for requiring payment of the appeal fee by an intervener who intervenes only at the appeal stage. Option C is also incorrect since it prescribes that both fees must be paid, which contradicts the rulings cited above stating that only the opposition fee needs to be paid.

If an attempt were made to amend the claim to merely address problems relating to Article 53(c) EPC by changing it to be directed only toward a heart pacemaker, this would likely constitute a change in the nature of the subject matter from method claims to apparatus claims.\n\nOption B is correct because:\n- **Amendment must not extend the scope**: The amendment cannot introduce new features or aspects that were not originally claimed or described.\n- **Category change**: Changing from a claim category (method) to another (apparatus) would be deemed an extension of the subject matter and therefore contravene Article 123(3) EPC.\n\nOption A is incorrect:\n- If it were permissible, this could lead to extensive changes in the scope of protection, which would violate the principle that amendments must not extend the original application's claims.

The Guidelines indicate that if a fee is paid shortly before the due date, it is possible that the EPO will not return the payment. However, in this case, since the fee was paid after the due date and the text does not mention any specific grace period for late payments, it is reasonable to assume that the fees are accepted as validly paid on 11 December 2023.

Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option C: There is no mention in the provided text about the EPO sending invitations for late payment fees or charging such fees. The only exceptions mentioned are renewal fees and voluntary payments in response to Rule 71(3) communications. Thus, this option is not supported by the given context.

Thus, the renewal fee for the third year should be paid by October 31, 2022, without any surcharge.\n\nThe correct date within a calendar year to avoid the surcharge is typically on or before October 31st of that year (see the EPO's Fee Rules and related guidelines). However, since option A refers to June 30, 2021, this is not relevant as it is too early in relation to when the application entered the regional phase.\n\nOption B (December 26, 2021) and Option D (January 17, 2022) are incorrect because they are either after the renewal period or not within the specified fee payment time frame.

However, based on the provided choices and their descriptions in the context of the question, none of the provided options (A-D) precisely match the correct period for payment without surcharge.

Since both claims 1 and 2 are validly filed and no relevant prior art has been discovered, they should both be allowed.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the priority rules under Rule 35(1) EPC, as well as the allowable subject matter based on the current state of knowledge regarding the application's contents.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_3.html"
