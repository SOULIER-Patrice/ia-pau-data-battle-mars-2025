                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (E-IX, 2.8), if an international application has been published 25 months after its filing date without any priority claimed, it falls outside of the normal 12-month priority period for filing a request for re-establishment under Rule 69 EPC and Art. 30(1) PCT. However, since the applicant wishes to enter the EP phase early (25 months post-filing), they must file a request for early processing using Form 1200.\n\nFor this request to be effective, applicants are required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in Rule 159(1) EPC. These requirements include:\n\n- Payment of the filing fee.\n- Filing of a translation if necessary under Art. 153(4).\n- Specification of the application documents.\n- Payment of the search fee, where a supplementary European search report has to be drawn up under Art. 153(7).\n\nSince the application is no more than 35 pages and includes 15 claims (which means no additional fees for more than 35 pages), and as there are no translations required by national office rules or other specified conditions, the only requirements are paying the filing fee and search fee.\n\nOption B incorrectly adds a renewal fee for the third year because the application has not yet reached that stage; therefore, it is premature to pay this fee. Option C includes appointing a representative, which might be necessary in some cases but is not explicitly required by Rule 159(1) EPC as stated in the guidelines provided.\n\nOption D is incorrect since A does reflect all necessary actions based on the given context and legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2022_MOCK_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_2.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2024_EPAC_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

If not paid or if designations are withdrawn after this period, the application is deemed withdrawn (EPC Case Law IV, A.7.2.1).

Specifically, in **T 1678/21** and **T 342/21**, it is stated that revoking an automatic debit order after the decisive payment date for the fee is too late to affect the payment. Applying this principle to the given scenario, once a particular fee has fallen due and can be debited, the decision about whether to execute the order cannot be changed even if it is specified in an automatic debit order. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee after 18 October 2024 would not affect the payment status, making **Answer C: 18 October 2024** incorrect as well.\n\nOption A (10 October 2024) is before the execution of the debit order and would not be considered by the EPO in deciding whether to execute the order. Option B (17 October 2024) is too late to revoke the order effectively after it has been executed. Although **Option D: A debit order cannot be revoked in part** is not explicitly stated, it aligns with the legal principles discussed and supports that only full revocation can undo the effect of an automatic debit order once executed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

The relevant excerpt from N.2.4 states, 'In T 146/07 anonymous third-party observations were received by the board at a very late stage. According to R. 114(1) EPC, any observations by a third party must be filed in writing.'\n\n- Option A is incorrect because it misinterprets the legal text; third-party observations are not made by parties involved in the proceedings and do not obligate the applicant to respond.\n- Option C is inaccurate as there are no fees required for filing third-party observations under Art. 115 EPC, contrary to what this option states.\n- Option D accurately reflects part of the legal requirement but is incomplete; it does not mention that these observations must be filed in an official language of the EPO and that they can also be anonymous (as shown in T 735/04), making B more comprehensive.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information from Case Law III, N.1 and N.2.4, only Option B correctly captures a key aspect of filing third-party observations: they must be filed in writing and cannot be submitted anonymously.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html"

Since the international patent application was filed on 10 September 2024, this action falls outside the priority period and therefore needs to be addressed separately.\n\nOption A (Request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO) is correct because it involves obtaining the required certified copy from the office that originally filed the Luxembourg patent application. This is a standard procedure for securing a priority claim, even if the original filing period has passed.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option B (Submit a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau to enable it to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application): The text indicates that this service is only available where the office participates in WIPO's Digital Access Service and cannot be used by the EPO or International Bureau for obtaining a priority document.\n\n- Option C (File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO): While digital copies are generally accepted, the text does not mention submitting an electronic copy directly to the EPO. For cases where the original office participation in DAS is not available, a paper version of the certified copy must be prepared and submitted.\n\n- Option D (File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau): The International Bureau typically deals only with PCT applications and would not process an international patent application filed directly with the EPO.

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.1, 'If the only admissible opposition or all the admissible oppositions are withdrawn and the opposition division takes the view that as the case stands there is no reason for the Office to continue the proceedings of its own motion, the proceedings are closed by means of a formal decision.' In this scenario, Firm B withdrew its opposition, so at the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent. Firm B would be entitled to file an appeal against this decision as per Article 106(2) EPC.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A is incorrect because the opposition was not revoked but maintained.\n- Option C is incorrect because Firm C filed observations under Art. 115 EPC, but did not initiate the opposition proceedings, so they would not have grounds to appeal a decision favorable to their position.\n- Option D is incorrect for two reasons: it states that Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings, which contradicts the scenario described (Firm B filed an opposition), and even if Firm B had withdrawn its opposition, this option incorrectly suggests that Firm C could file an appeal based on observations under Art. 115 EPC rather than a formal opposition.\n\nBased on the legal text provided, only Option B accurately describes the situation where Firm B is entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision of maintaining the patent as granted after withdrawal of their opposition.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_1.html"

According to Article 14(2), this is permissible if a corresponding translation into one of the official languages of the EPO is provided within the required time limit.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the provided guidelines and case law, PCT Direct can be applied under certain conditions which include having a priority application that has been searched by the EPO. Here's why option B is correct while the others are incorrect:\n\n1. **Option A**: This scenario might seem plausible at first glance because it involves an application filed in French, but since we don't have specific details about the availability of PCT Direct for such a situation (i.e., Belgian national applications), and no explicit mention is made in the provided guidelines, this option cannot be definitively ruled as incorrect based on the given text. However, there's no explicit reference to 'ePCT -Filing' either.\n\n2. **Option B**: This scenario correctly states that PCT Direct can be applied if the priority application (EP) was filed and searched in French, and the international application is subsequently filed in English. The key point here is that both applications are filed with the EPO and the conditions for using PCT Direct are met.\n\n3. **Option C**: This scenario correctly describes a situation where an international application has already been filed (in English) before the search was completed by the EPO, so there isn't a priority application to file amendments under PCT Direct. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it doesn't meet the criteria for PCT Direct.\n\n4. **Option D**: While it's often necessary to submit amended claims when using PCT Direct (as per standard practice), the given text does not explicitly state that filing amended claims as a single PDF document is a requirement for applying PCT Direct, making this statement less certain compared to option B which directly aligns with the guidelines' scope.\n\nIn conclusion, while Options A and D are somewhat ambiguous in their phrasing due to lack of explicit references, Option C clearly does not fit within the conditions described by the provided legal text. Thus, **Option B is the correct answer** as it accurately reflects a scenario where PCT Direct can be used according to the guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2022_MOCK_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Art. 14(2) of the EPC and Rule R.60(2)(a) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Patent Office (RPO), when requesting unitary effect, a translation of the application into one of the official languages of any state that has acceded or will have acceded to the Unitary Patent Framework Agreement (UPCA) must be provided. The 18 states to which Mr Linguist’s application is extended are all signatories to the UPCA as of now. Therefore, a translation of the specification into an official language of these 18 states would be required for immediate registration of the unitary effect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while Dutch may have been used in the initial filing, Art. 14(2) does not allow translations to be filed in languages other than those specified as official languages under RPO Rule 3(2).\n\nOption C is also incorrect since it refers to all 24 states that signed the UPCA, which is broader than necessary for determining the language of the required translation. The relevant requirement is based on the states to which unitary effect has been requested.\n\nOption D is incorrect because Spanish is not an official language of any state party to the UPCA, and thus cannot be used for translations in this context according to Art. 14(2) EPC and RPO Rule 60(2)(a).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

According to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date. Consequently, the 31-month period expires 31 months from the priority date to be restored. A period of one month is permitted for filing a request for restoration of priority at the EPO under Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT and Article 22 PCT. Merely fulfilling the requirements of Rule 159(1) earlier than 31 months from the priority date will not change this, as the EPO can only start processing the application before the 31-month time limit if this is expressly requested by the applicant. If the applicant requests early processing and complies with the requirements of Rule 159(1), the effective date of early entry will change, and the time limit for requesting restoration of the priority period will be one month from the effective date (Euro-PCT Guide, 15th edition, 2022, 5.13.022 – 5.13.023; Guidelines E-IX, 2.8.)"

The applicant is entitled to a reduction of 20% in the examination fee under Rule 6(3) EPC and Article 14(1) RFees, as they have filed the European patent application in an admissible non-EPO language (Spanish). \\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\nThe rules for filing fees, including reductions, are detailed in the relevant sections of the EPC. According to EPC Rule 6(3), a 20% reduction is available when the application is filed in an admissible non-EPO language, such as Spanish. Since the applicant has satisfied this requirement by filing the application and requesting examination in Spanish, they are entitled to the 20% reduction.\\n\\n### Why Option B is Incorrect:\\n\\nOption B suggests that a reduction exists but at a different percentage than 20%. However, based on EPC Rule 6(3) and Article 14(1) RFees, the specific reduction amount for filing in an admissible non-EPO language like Spanish is clearly stated as 20%. Therefore, this option cannot be correct.\\n\\n### Why Other Options are Not Applicable:\\n\\nThe question does not provide other options (C or D), but if they were to exist, they would likely indicate incorrect interpretations of the fee reduction rules. Given that only Option A correctly aligns with the provided legal text and EPC regulations, there is no need to address them here.\\n\\nIn conclusion, since the applicant has met all eligibility criteria for the 20% reduction as per Rule 6(3) EPC and Article 14(1) RFees, they are indeed entitled to a 20% reduction in the examination fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 7a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r7a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_2.html"

The time which has not yet elapsed shall begin to run from the date on which proceedings are resumed, and this period is not less than two months. \n\nIn this case:\n- Proceedings were interrupted on 20 October 2021 under Rule 142 EPC.\n- The invitation for comments was sent on 16 August 2021 with a three-month time limit (under Rule 82(2) EPC), meaning the time limit would have normally expired by 15 November 2021.\n- Since the proceedings were interrupted, this period of interruption applies to the three-month time limit.\n\nThe resumption date was on 16 January 2022. From that date, at least two months must be added (as per Rule 142(4)). Thus, we calculate as follows:\n16 January 2022 + 2 months = 15 March 2022.\n\nHowever, the time limit for responding to an invitation under Rule 82 is three months. This means that even though the interruption rules require at least two months after resumption, the full three-month period of the original invitation still applies, but it starts from when proceedings resume and runs continuously without the gap caused by the interruption.\n\nTherefore, the time limit would end on:\n16 August 2021 + 3 months = 15 November 2021 (normal expiry).\nSince this period was interrupted until 16 January 2022, we add three months from that date to get:\n16 January 2022 + 3 months = 19 April 2022.\n\nExplanation why B is incorrect: Option B suggests a date of 30 April 2022. However, because the period was interrupted and then resumed with a minimum two-month period after resumption, it logically should end on 19 April 2022 to respect both the original three-month limit and the EPC Rule 142(4) requirements.\n\nTherefore, Answer A is correct based on the legal text provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_4_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_4_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r14.html"

Since the certificate was obtained from this authority after the exhibition ended, it fails to satisfy this requirement.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because although the certificate was filed within four months of filing the European patent application, the critical aspect highlighted in Rule 25(d) – that the certificate must be issued during the exhibition by the relevant authority – was not met.

In this case, the applicant should ensure that the payment is made well before the deadline to avoid any delays due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests doing nothing and relying on the EPO to consider it a valid payment even if late.

Late payments are not automatically accepted.\n  \n- **Option B** (Effect the payment no later than 13 August 2023): While this choice is more conservative and safer than option D, it might still be too close to the deadline for comfort, especially if there could be delays in the transfer process.\n\n- **Option C** (Effect the payment no later than 8 August 2023): This would provide a buffer of five days but may still leave room for unforeseen circumstances such as bank holidays or other delays.\n  \n- **Option D** (It is sufficient to effect the payment on the last day, that is on 18 August 2023): This option is incorrect because according to the guidelines, it must be paid well before the deadline to ensure there's enough time for any delays.

Since no notice of appeal has been filed as of today (15 July 2023), and assuming that the time limit for filing an appeal has not yet expired by this date, the refusal decision does not mean the application is no longer pending. The Enlarged Board of Appeal in G 1/09 defined a 'pending (earlier) European patent application' as one where substantive rights deriving therefrom under the EPC are still in existence until the expiry of the time limit for filing an appeal. Since no such notice has been filed, the refusal decision does not preclude further actions like filing a divisional application. Option B is incorrect because it suggests that the refusal of EP-A definitively ends its pendency, which is not the case as long as there's no appeal filed within the allowed time frame. Option C is incorrect because it implies an additional requirement (appealing the decision) that was not necessary for filing a divisional application according to the provided legal texts. The mere refusal of an application does not preclude further action unless an appeal is also required, which in this case has not occurred.

Since 10 January 2023 + 1 year = 10 January 2024, this is when the first renewal fee is due without any surcharge.\n\n- The question asks for the last day to pay it in 2023 without a surcharge; therefore, we need to consider the month containing 10 January. Therefore, the relevant date would be May 2023 (the following year's same month).\n\nOption A suggests 31 January 2023, which is incorrect because:\n- It does not align with Rule 51(1) EPC that states fees are due one year after filing.\n- It refers to a date in the previous year, leading to potential surcharge for late payment.\n\nOption B (2 May 2023) correctly identifies this as being the last day of March 2024 minus three months, fitting Rule 51(1) EPC's timing. Thus, paying on or before 2 May 2023 would be within the one-month window without incurring a surcharge for late payment.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they either suggest a date not aligned with the rules (A), or misinterpret the time frame and calculation of deadlines as per EPC regulations.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2022_EPAC_open_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Article 86, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a86.html"

Since EP-1 was filed in February 2023, it falls within the one-year period from March 2022 when US-1 was filed. Therefore, the applicant can still add a priority declaration to EP-1.\nExplanation of why option A is incorrect: This choice is incorrect because there has not been more than 16 months between the filing date of US-1 and the filing date of EP-1 (February 2023 - March 2022 = 11 months).

This is because, in such cases, the rights acquired with the patent remain in existence during the period up to surrender or lapse, and claims arising from those rights may subsist after that date. Therefore, option A correctly explains why an opposition can still be filed.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it contradicts the legal context provided by Rule 75 EPC and other relevant guidelines. The text clearly states that even if a patent has been surrendered or lapsed, an opposition can still be filed due to the continued existence of certain rights. Thus, there is indeed a reason for opposing such patents.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misinterprets the legal effect of surrender or lapse versus revocation. According to the context, Rule 75 EPC states that 'Surrender or lapse has immediate nonretroactive effect (i.e., patent protection ceases on the date of surrender or lapse),' meaning these actions do not have an ex tunc effect as stated in option C. Instead, it is revocation that is deemed to have had no effect from the outset.

In this scenario, since the exclusive licensee in Germany does not have any explicit authority to file such a request according to the rules, it cannot act independently.\n- The other option B is incorrect because the presence of an exclusive licensee, while potentially having significant commercial interests, does not give them automatic rights to revoke the patent unless specifically authorized by the proprietor.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: This statement is unnecessary as the request from the proprietor itself is admissible.

The last allowable date to file a divisional application cannot be the same day as or after the date of publication in the bulletin.\n\nTherefore, based on the legal context provided, the correct answer is D (23 May 2023).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_2.html\nSource: OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

According to Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1 and 9.2.2, an applicant entitled to a fee reduction under Rule 6(3) of the European Patent Convention (EPC) can benefit from this reduction not only on the basic filing fees but also on additional fees such as those for pages in excess of 35.\\n\\nSpecifically, the context states: 'The language reduction under Rule 6(3) applies if the requirements of Rule 6(4), Rule 6(6), and Rule 6(7) have been met (see A-X, 9.2.1 and A-X, 9.2.2). This indicates that the fee reduction extends to additional fees like those for extra pages.\\n\\nExplanation for why Answer B ('No') is incorrect:\\nAnswer B is incorrect because it contradicts the clear statement in the guidelines that the language reduction under Rule 6(3) also applies to additional fees, including the page fee.

The original claim 1 in EP-1 defines a polymer blend XY containing, as a filler, graphite, talc, asbestos or silica. To restrict this list by simply omitting asbestos (thus claiming only graphite, talc or silica) would be an extension of the claims beyond the scope disclosed in the application as originally filed. This is not permissible under Article 123(2) EPC. Option A (Yes) is incorrect because omitting asbestos without proper grounds would constitute an impermissible extension.

Specifically, this rule states that corrections can be made on request at any time provided that proceedings are pending before the EPO (see J 42/92). However, if the error concerns items that third parties might expect to take at face value and whose correction would jeopardize their rights, the request for correction must be filed as soon as possible, and at least in time for incorporation in the publication of the European patent application. \n\nOption B is correct because it aligns with the legal context provided. According to OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, corrections under Rule 139 EPC are only possible up to the time the decision is handed over to the EPO's internal postal service.\n\nExplanation for why Answer A and C are incorrect:\n\n- **Answer A** suggests that the request can be made until the applicant or their representative has received the decision to grant. This is incorrect because Rule 139 EPC does not refer to any post-issuance date, such as when the applicant receives the decision. Instead, it focuses on the period during which proceedings are pending before the European Patent Office.\n\n- **Answer C** proposes that corrections can be made until the expiry of the time limit for replying to a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. This is also incorrect as Rule 71(3) pertains to communications from the Examining Division and not specifically to the correction of errors in documents filed with the European Patent Office.

According to the provided legal texts, Rule 139 EPC allows for the correction of significant typographical errors before the decision to grant a European patent application (EP-1) under Rule 71a(1) EPC.\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Answer C is Correct:**\n   - The text explicitly states that 'Rule 139 EPC applies only during the examination procedure and before the granting of the patent' (Case Law III, L.2). This means that the applicant can seek correction under Rule 139 EPC for typographical errors found before the decision to grant is issued.\n   - The provided information also mentions that 'since the final responsibility for the text of the patent lies with applicants or patentees,' they should ensure proper checking of all documents (Guidelines H-VI, 3.1). This further supports the option of correcting typographical errors under Rule 139 EPC.\n\n2. **Answer B is Incorrect:**\n   - Rule 140 EPC applies to decisions made by the Boards of Appeal and first-instance departments, but it does not cover corrections of the text of a patent or legal errors (Case Law III, L.2). It specifically states that 'R. 140 EPC no longer covers the correction of the text of a patent' following Case Law G 1/10.\n   - Therefore, Rule 140 EPC cannot be used to correct typographical errors in claim 1 after the decision to grant has been issued.\n\n3. **Answer A is Incorrect:**\n   - While it might seem logical that no action can be taken at all (option A), this contradicts the clear provision found in Rule 139 EPC, which allows for corrections of typographical errors before granting.\n   - The legal texts indicate that 'requests for correction under R. 139 of documents on which the patent is granted may under certain conditions be submitted in opposition and limitation proceedings' (Guidelines H-VI, 3.1).

This conclusion can be drawn from several points in the provided text:\n\n1. **Article 123(3) EPO**: The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (H-V, 7. Changes in Claim Category in Opposition) highlight that a change of category is only allowed if it is necessitated by grounds for opposition and must be done with caution because 'the protection as conferred by the claims may thus be extended.' In this case, changing from a method claim to an apparatus claim (a change in claim category) would likely extend the protection beyond what was initially disclosed or claimed.\n\n2. **Technical Feasibility vs. Treatment Method**: The provided text mentions that an actual operating method for a pacemaker is not patentable as it defines a method of treatment, whereas claims referring to structural features are acceptable. Here, changing from a method claim to an apparatus claim (pacemaker) would still be considered a change in category, which could extend the scope of protection beyond what was initially disclosed.\n\n3. **Problems with Article 53(c) EPC**: The question specifically mentions addressing issues related to Article 53(c) EPC, which concerns medical methods as such. While changing the claim category might indirectly address this by focusing on the pacemaker rather than the method of use during exercise, it still constitutes a change in category and therefore would contravene Article 123(3) if not justified by grounds for opposition.\n\nOption A ('Yes, a change in claim category is permitted.') is incorrect because changing from a method to an apparatus (pacemaker) in this context would likely extend the scope of protection beyond what was initially disclosed or claimed. This extension of the claim's scope without clear necessity due to opposition would contravene Article 123(3) EPC.\n\nThe text also supports this by highlighting that even if a change is necessitated, great caution must be exercised, and any amendment could give rise to issues under Article 123(3). The same applies for the other options; they are incorrect because they fail to recognize the limitations imposed by Articles 123(3) and 53(c) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law II, E.2.7.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_2_7_5.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.2.7.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_2_7_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-V, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_v_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 80, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r80.html"

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO state that 'Where the applicant has not, within the time limit under paragraph (c), furnished the required translation and paid any required late furnishing fee, the international application shall be considered withdrawn' (Source: PCT Rule 12 Content). This indicates that failure to pay by the due date leads to automatic withdrawal of the application unless specified otherwise.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect. The text in the '2024_EPAC_open_solution.json' and 'OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json' documents clearly state, 'The fees will be accepted as if they had been paid within the one-month period,' but only if the payment was made before an invitation for late payment fee (Rule 16bis.1 PCT) was issued by 11 December 2023 (Source: OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json). In this scenario, since the fees were not paid until after that date, it is unlikely they will be accepted as timely payments.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because there is no specific mention of sending an invitation to pay a late payment fee of 50% of the fees due. The text does indicate potential imposition of a late payment fee but specifies that such a late payment fee would only apply if the receiving office issues an invitation after the initial one-month period has expired (Source: PCT Rule 16bis).

It does not adhere to the strict timing as stipulated in the guidelines.\n\n- **Answer D: 4 December 2023**\n  - Similar to Answer C, this date exceeds the necessary time frame and is thus incorrect according to the legal context provided.\n\nThe correct answer (B) accurately reflects the two-month period from 2 October 2023, ensuring that applicants have a sufficient timeframe to respond while adhering to the procedural requirements of the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 16.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_16_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 3.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_3_2_1.html"

The applicant must also show that they were unable, despite taking all due care, to meet the time limit for claiming priority.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it does not address the possibility of restoration and incorrectly states that the 12-month period has expired. In reality, there is a one-month window after the deadline to file a request for restoration based on 'due care' criteria.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, although 'further processing' can be requested under Rule 159(1), this does not specifically relate to restoring a right of priority and may not address unintentional lapses that would require showing due care. Additionally, there's no direct provision for 'requesting further processing' in the context of restoration of priority rights.\n\nOption D is almost correct but incomplete as it only mentions one aspect (due care) without addressing other relevant criteria such as filing within the one-month window and proving unintentional omission despite taking all due care.

The EPO guidelines state that if a mention of the grant is published on the anniversary of the filing date, then the renewal fee for the next patent year is due on the start of that new patent year.\\n\\nHence, the third-year renewal fee would be payable at the beginning of 2023, which is 2 January 2022 (the first business day of the year).\\n\\n- **Option A: 30 June 2021** - This date does not align with the start of any patent years based on the entry date for PCT-1.

By paying the additional search fee within that timeframe (here, two months from today, when EP-1 enters the European regional phase), the applicant retains the option to protect claim 10 without incurring costs immediately. \\n\\n**Why Option B is Correct:**\\n- **Option B**: The applicant can pay an additional search fee for the invention of independent claim 10 within two months of entry into the EPO regional phase (i.e., today). This allows them to have this invention searched and protected, as per Rule 164(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Patent Office.\\n\\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\\n- **Option A**: Filing a divisional application is not an option for protecting claim 10 during the initial examination phase.

Since FP1 was filed ten months earlier than FP2 and is still pending, any subject matter disclosed in FP1 at the filing date of FP2 can be considered as prior art under Article 54(3) EPC if it has not been published before.\\n- Given that FP1 is still pending, its disclosure cannot be cited against FP2 for claiming priority. However, once FP1 is granted and published, it will become prior art and could affect the novelty of subject-matter A in EP1.\\n- For claim 1 related to subject-matter A, the priority from FP2 should be valid as there was no publication before the filing date of FP2 (and therefore not yet known when claiming priority). Hence, this claim can likely be granted in EP1 with a valid priority claim.\\n\\nExplanation for incorrect options:\\n- B is correct but incorrectly stated; the invalidity only affects subject-matter A from the earlier application and not both claims.\\n- C is incorrect: It incorrectly assumes that FP1 becoming prior art would invalidate both claims 1 and 2.
