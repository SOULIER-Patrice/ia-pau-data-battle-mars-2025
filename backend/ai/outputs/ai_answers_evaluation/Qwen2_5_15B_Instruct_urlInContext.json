            "Question": "  Your client CoffeeBreak filed a European patent application claiming a new type of coffee maker on 20 December 2021 but withdrew it before search. CoffeeBreak then asked you to file an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application and with no amendments compared to that application. The priority application contains drawings that are essential for understanding the invention.  On 5 December 2022, you filed an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application at the International Bureau, using PCT/RO/101. Your colleague handling a patent application for shoe soles left by mistake his drawings in your filing folder. Therefore, you filed the wrong drawings with the international patent application claiming the coffee maker instead of the correct drawings.  a. You discover your mistake today, 12 December 2022. Assuming that the International Bureau does not detect the wrong drawings, what actions can you take of your own volition to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. b. You do not discover your mistake until receiving a PCT/RO/107 notification dated 4 January 2023 from the International Bureau. What actions can you take to ensure that the correct drawings are included in the international patent application while maintaining the original filing date? What is the applicable time limit for performing these actions? Please give reasons for your answer. c. What would be your answer to previous questions (a) and (b) if, at your client's request, you had not claimed priority of the European patent application? Please give reasons for your answer.  You do not discover your mistake on filing the wrong drawings, and completely miss the notification dated 4 January 2023 from the International Bureau. You only find out about the mistake on 27 April 2023 after receiving the written opinion. The invention has not been and will not be made public by any means other than publication by the International Bureau. You intend to withdraw the international patent application before publication and file a new international patent application with the correct drawings.  d. Will you still be in time to prevent publication of the first international patent application? Please give reasons for your answer. ",
            "Answer": "(a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) together with the confirmation. Within two months of the original filing date 5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 6 February. (b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority application are included in the international patent application through incorporation by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together with the confirmation). RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 2023 (c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. (d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of technical preparations for the publication. Publication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, which is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). The technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the date of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on Tuesday, 6 June).",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the scenario, let's break down each part:\n\n### Part a: Discovering Mistake Before Notification\n\n#### Actions:\n- **Send a corrected copy of the drawings to the International Bureau along with a formal letter confirming that the drawings are now correct.**\n- **Inform the International Bureau of the discrepancy between the drawings in the priority application and the ones submitted in the international application.**\n\n#### Time Limit:\n- **Two months from the original filing date plus two months extension**: This is because the priority claim allows for a two-month grace period.\n\n#### Reasons:\n- **Maintain Original Filing Date**: By sending a corrected copy of the drawings, you maintain the original filing date of 5 December 2022.\n- **Correct Drawings**: Ensuring the correct drawings are included prevents confusion and ensures clarity regarding the invention.\n\n### Part b: Discovering Mistake After Notification\n\n#### Actions:\n- **Send a corrected copy of the drawings to the International Bureau along with a formal letter confirming that the drawings are now correct.**\n- **Inform the International Bureau of the discrepancy between the drawings in the priority application and the ones submitted in the international application.**\n\n#### Time Limit:\n- **Two months from the original filing date plus two months extension**: Similar to part a, this applies because the priority claim allows for a two-month grace period.\n\n#### Reasons:\n- **Maintain Original Filing Date**: By sending a corrected copy of the drawings, you maintain the original filing date of 5 December 2022.\n- **Correct Drawings**: Ensuring the correct drawings are included prevents confusion and ensures clarity regarding the invention.\n\n### Part c: Not Claiming Priority\n\n#### Actions:\n- **Do not file an international patent application claiming priority of the European patent application.**\n\n#### Time Limit:\n- **No specific time limit**: Since there is no priority claim, there is no need to adhere to the two-month grace period.\n\n#### Reasons:\n- **Avoid Confusion**: Failing to claim priority avoids potential issues related to the two-month grace period.\n- **Clarity**: Without a priority claim, there is less risk of confusion over the inclusion of the correct drawings.\n\n### Part d: Mistake Found After Publication\n\n#### Actions:\n- **Withdraw the international patent application before publication and file a new international patent application with the correct drawings.**\n\n#### Time Limit:\n- **Before publication**: This is crucial since publication occurs after the expiration of 18\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_5_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56.html"

            "Question": "  On 10 December 2021, your client, a large Romanian company, filed a Romanian national patent application RO-H. RO-H is drafted in Romanian and comprises 32 pages of description and drawings, and four pages with 15 claims. Your client has informed you that they will prepare and forward an English translation of RO-H in due course. This will comprise 29 pages of description and drawings, four pages with 15 claims and an abstract comprising two pages. Your client wants you to file today, 12 December 2022, a European patent application EP-H drafted in Romanian and claiming priority of RO-H.  a. What fees have to be paid and what would be the last date for paying them? b. You filed an automatic debit order for EP-H. On the decisive payment date, you receive an email from the EPO informing you that there are insufficient funds in your deposit account to cover any of the fees to be paid (as identified in your answer to question (a)). You replenish the account two days after receiving the email. Do you have to take any further action to ensure these fees are paid? c. What is the time limit for filing an English translation of the application via the EPO's online services? What is the consequence for the time limit if, on the last day of the period for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services which prevents you from filing it? The outage lasts for the whole of that day. ",
            "Answer": "(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 9 The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). (b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was duly replenished (point 8 AAD). Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)). (c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC. If documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted by the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be received on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the period shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are available (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120). ",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the questions:\n\n### a. Fees to be Paid\n\nBased on the context provided, the fees that need to be paid include:\n\n- **Filing Fee**: As per Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC, the filing fee should be paid within one month of filing, i.e., by 12 January 2023.\n\n- **Search Fee**: The search fee is part of the filing fee and includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of abstract minus 35 pages = 2 pages).\n\n- **Translation Fee**: According to content (c), a translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application. Therefore, the deadline for filing the translation is 12 February 2023.\n\n### b. Action Required After Replenishing the Account\n\nAfter replenishing the account two days after receiving the email about insufficient funds, the next step is to pay the remaining fees. The EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee, and the filing fee (including the page fee). \n\nSince the account is now replenished, the necessary actions are:\n\n- **Pay the Remaining Fees**: Proceed with paying the filing fee, search fee, and translation fee immediately.\n\n### c. Time Limit for Filing an English Translation\n\nAccording to content (c):\n\n- **Time Limit for Filing Translation**: The deadline for filing an English translation via the EPO’s online services is two months from the filing date of the application. For RO-H, this translates to 12 February 2023.\n\nIf, on the last day of the period for filing the translation, there is an unplanned outage of the EPO's online services preventing you from filing it, the consequences are:\n\n- **Outage Duration**: The outage lasts for the entire day.\n\n- **Consequence**: The time limit for filing the translation is extended until the first working day after the outage ends. Assuming the outage starts on 13 February 2023 and ends on 14 February 2023, the extension would make the final filing deadline 15 February 2023.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- **Fee Payment Deadline**: 12 January 2023\n- **Translation Deadline**: 12 February 2023\n- **Action Required**: Pay the remaining fees immediately upon\nContext: \nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

            "Question": "  Applicant A filed European patent application EP-A1 in English in May 2019. It describes two different inventions, X and Y, and claims invention X only. The European search report was drawn up for invention X only. A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting a time limit of four months for response was issued by the EPO on 16 May 2022. A two-month extension of this time limit was granted on 26 September 2022. As of today’s date, no response has been filed. Applicant A is now interested in invention Y. Today, 12 December 2022, he files a European divisional application EP-A2 based on EP-A1 and describing invention Y. No fees were paid, and no claims were submitted at the time of filing.  What does applicant A have to do to have invention Y searched by the EPO?",
            "Answer": "A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending. Currently, EP-A1 is deemed to be withdrawn because no response to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC was filed. The time limit for filing a response expired on 28 November 2022 (26 Saturday > Monday 28). In order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request further processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the communication under Article 94(3) EPC. The filing fee and search fee for EP-A2 are due on filing. They may be paid within one month of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 36(3) EPC). The third renewal fee and the fourth renewal fee for the divisional become due on filing. They can be validly paid without surcharge within four months of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 51(3) EPC) (otherwise with surcharge within six months of the same date). The applicant should file claims directed to invention Y (Rule 40(1) EPC) in response to a communication from the EPO (under Rule 58 EPC setting a time limit of two months from the date of receipt to supply claims) at the latest.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To have invention Y searched by the EPO, applicant A must file a request for examination within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report for invention X.\n\nSpecifically, according to Rule 70(1) of the EPC:\n\n\"The applicant may request examination of the European patent application up to six months after the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report.\"\n\nSince the European search report for invention X was published on the date mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin, applicant A should file his request for examination within six months from that date.

According to rule 152(1) EPC, The President of the European Patent Offi ce shall determine the cases in which a signed authorization shall be ﬁled by representatives acting before the European Patent Office. In decision of the President of the EPO of 12.07.2007 on the ﬁling of authorizations (Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2 007, L.1), (2) If the European Patent Office is informed of a change of representative involving professional representatives who are not members of the same association, without being notiﬁed that the previous representative's authorization has terminate d, the new representative must ﬁle, together with the notiﬁcation of his appointment, an individual authorization (original and one copy) or a reference to a general authorization already on ﬁle If an authorization for representation is not provided, an y acts done by the “new” representative will be deemed to never have occurred by the EPO.

Additionally, there is a time limit of 6 months from the notification of the appointment for the applicant to respond to the written opinion and file a response to the search opinion accompanying the supplementary European search report.

            "Question": "Last week Greta validly filed the international patent application PCT -G with the German Patent and Trade mark Office ( DPMA ) and appointed Hassan to represent her. Hassan is entitled to act before the DPMA  but he is not a European patent attorney. Greta and Hassan are resident in Germany.  Which of the following statements is not correct?\n A. Hassan can represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority for PCT -G.\nB. In order for Hassan to be able to act before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority , he needs to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta.\nC. According to the provisions of the PCT, it is mandatory that the d emand for international preliminary examination is signed by Greta or Hassan.\nD. According to the provisions of the PCT, an international application can only be withdrawn by the applicant or an agent appointed by a power of attorney.",
            "Answer": "Answer: B\n\nJustification: Legal basis Rule 90.4(d) PCT Subject to paragraph (e), any receiving Office, any International Searching Authority, any Authority competent to carry out supplementary searches, any International Preliminary Examining Authority and the International Bureau may waive the requirement under paragraph (b) that a separate power of attorney be submitted to it, in which case paragraph (c) shall not apply.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is:\n\nC. According to the provisions of the PCT, it is mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination is signed by Greta or Hassan.\n\nExplanation:\n\nAccording to PCT Article 9, the concept of residence and nationality, and the application of those concepts in cases where there are several applicants or where the applicants are not the same for all the designated States, are defined in the Regulations. This means that the regulations governing the PCT specify how residency and nationality are determined, particularly when dealing with multiple applicants or different designated States.\n\nIn this scenario, Greta is a resident of Germany and she has appointed Hassan to represent her in filing the international patent application PCT-G with the German Patent and Trade Mark Office (DPMA). Since Greta is a resident of Germany, she qualifies as a resident under the PCT.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the requirement for the demand for international preliminary examination to be signed by either Greta or Hassan. While both Greta and Hassan have the authority to act before the DPMA, according to the PCT, the demand for international preliminary examination must be submitted by the applicant or an agent appointed by a power of attorney. This is because the PCT does not require signatures on the demand itself, but rather that the demand be properly prepared and presented by the applicant or their authorized representative.\n\nTherefore, statement C is not correct because it implies that the demand must be signed by Greta or Hassan, whereas the PCT allows for the submission of the demand by the applicant or their authorized representative.\nContext: \nSource: PCT Article 49, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a49.html\nSource: Case Law II, D.2.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_d_2_2_3.html\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_3_1.html\nSource: PCT Article 9, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a9.html"

Further processing is only available to applicants (and thus before grant). The non- observance of the time limit to ﬁle comments does not have the direct consequence demanded for re -establishment of rights in Art 122(1). [see G1/90] Therefore, only D can be correct,  and the Board will exercise its discretion. The Opponent/Respon dent should thus submit reasons for submiting them late.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: D. None of the above.\n\nExplanation: According to the guidelines provided, the opponent/respondent should file comments within a period of four months after receiving the communication from the board of appeal. Since the opponent/respondent has already filed comments on 12 October 2023, there is no need to request an extension of the period for comment. Additionally, paying a fee for further processing is not required as per the guidelines.

            "Question": "A European patent application was filed on 20 March 2020. Proceedings were interrupted under  Rule 142 EPC on 10  March 2022. The applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed today, 12 October 2023. No renewal fee has been paid so far . Which of the following statements is correct?\n A. As no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn .\nB. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest .\nC. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional  fee by 30  April 2024 at the latest .\nD. The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31  October 2023 at the latest .",
            "Answer": "Answer: B\n\nJustification: Legal basis Guidelines, E -Vii.1.5 Concerning renewal fees falling due during the period of interruption, Rule 142(4) has to be interpreted as deferring the due date for their payment until the date the proceedings are resumed (J 902/87). Thus, such renewal fees may be paid without additional fee at the date of resumption and in the amounts applicable on that date. They may also be paid within six months of said date, provided that an additional fee is also paid within said period (Rule 51(2)).",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: The correct answer is: D.\n\nExplanation: \nAccording to the guidelines, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest. This is because the earliest date for validly paying the third-year renewal fee is 31 July 2020, and the last day for validly paying the fourth-year renewal fee is 4 November 2020. Therefore, the renewal fees can be paid until 31 October 2023 without any additional fee. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the application is not deemed to be withdrawn unless the renewal fees are paid.\nOption B is incorrect because the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest.\nOption C is incorrect because the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_solution_mcq.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2022_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A"

This patent application is currently under examination and a notice of allowance is not expected before 2024. On 20 November 2022, your law firm validly filed a European patent application EP -A in the applicant's name, c laiming priority from US -A. A communication under Rule 64(1) EPC is issued on 5 September 2023, indicating a lack of unity because application EP -A comprises three inventions: A1, A2 and A3. 1. What is the deadline for responding to this communication? Sh ow your calculations. 2. What steps need to be taken to receive the final search report for invention A1 only? 3. What steps need to be taken to receive the final search report covering all three inventions? 4. What steps need to be taken to enable the ap plicant to obtain examination of inventions A1 and A3 by the EPO? The applicant informs your law firm that it wants to accelerate examination of invention A1 by using Form 1009 or Form 1005. 5. Can you use these forms to accelerate the proceedings? Please explain your answer.  2 Following a successful request for accelerated examination, a communication under Article 94(3) EPC is issued on A1, but the applicant needs more time to formulate a response and requests an extension of the time limit. 6. What effect  will this request for an extension of the time limit have on the prosecution of A1? ",
            "Answer": "(a) (Rule 64(1)) has a deadline of 2m from the notification of the communication, therefore the 10-day rule still currently applies. 5 September 2023 + 10d = 15 September 2023 + 2m = 15 November 2023.  (b) No action is required. If no response is filed to the R64(1) communication, the published search report will be based on the first mentioned invention (i.e., A1).  (c) Pay two additional search fees (before the calculated deadline of 15 November 2023). A further search report will be issued covering all three inventions.  (d) Request examination for EP-A and file a divisional application for the second invention. (e) A PPH request based on the US-priority application with the USPTO as OEE cannot be filed by using Form 1009 (as the US priority is still under substantive examination). EPO Form 1005 can be used to request accelerated examination (PACE).  (f)  EP-A will be taken out of the PACE programme due to the request for extension of time.",

Since priority was not claimed on filing, Rule 56a(4) EPC does not apply. The application is re-dated. 3. As the new filing date falls outside the 12-month priority period, a request for re-establishment in respect of the priority period should also be filed, together with reasons. And the fee should be paid.",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To address the questions:\n\n1. **Explanation of Priority Claiming from CN1:**\n   - According to the guidelines, even though EP1 was filed without claiming priority, it is still possible to claim priority from CN1 because CN1 was filed within 12 months of EP1's filing date. Therefore, priority can be claimed from CN1 until 16 months from the earliest priority date.\n\n2. **Correction of Description Translation Error:**\n   - To correct the error, the applicant needs to translate the description of the application into English and file it along with the necessary declarations and translations. This ensures that the description accurately reflects the content of CN1.\n\n3. **Consequence of Claiming Priority from CN1:**\n   - Claiming priority from CN1 would result in EP1 receiving the priority date of CN1. However, since EP1 was originally filed without claiming priority, the priority claim from CN1 would invalidate the original filing date of EP1.\n\n4. **Action Required:**\n   - The applicant should amend the priority claim to reflect the correct priority date from CN1. Additionally, they need to ensure that the description of the application is accurate and properly translated into English.\n\nIn summary, while it is still possible to claim priority from CN1, the applicant must take corrective actions such as translating the description into English and amending the priority claim accordingly. These changes will affect the validity of the filing date and the priority claim.\nContext: \nSource: 2024_EPAC_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: 2022_MOCK_solution_open.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_4_1.html"

            "Question": " Inventor Mr Tulip, a Dutch national, filed Dutch national patent application NL- 1, which comprises 50 pages and includes 20 claims, all in the Dutch language. The EPO established a search report at the request of the Netherlands Patent Office. Mr Tulip then filed an international patent application WO -1, claiming the priority of, and with the same content (description and claims in Dutch) as, NL- 1.  The international publication of WO -1, with the international search report, comprises 45 pages, including 1 page of bibliographic data. The EPO acted as International Searching Authority. International preliminary examination was requested in time; however, no amendments were made in the international phase. 30 months have elapsed since the date of filing of NL- 1.  Mr Tulip now asks for an indication of the cost of entry into the European phase, i.e. how much he will have to pay in official fees over the next 8 months, if all formal requirements are met but expenses kept to a minimum. This will be his first applicati on with the EPO. Mr Tulip expressly requests that no amendments be made before substantive examination. Please name the fees that need to be paid and state which reductions are available. It is sufficient to indicate how to calculate, but it is not necessary to indicate the amounts nor to provide full calculations. 6. (3 po ints) Third -party observations were filed regarding a patent application. They were sent to the applicant with a communication (Form 2022) dated 22 November 2023.  1. What did the applicant have to do and by what date?  2. The EPO then sent a communication under Art. 94(3) dated 21 December 2023, setting a period of 4 months to respond. It was received by the applicant on 28 December 2023. The applicant requested a first extension of 2 months in time, and this was granted by a communication dated 19 April 2024 and received on 26 April 2024. The applicant wished to request a second time extension. What did the applicant then have to do and by what date? 3. The second request for extension of time was filed on the last possible date but was refused. The applicant was then informed by a noting of loss of rights that the application had been deemed to be withdrawn for failure to file a response in time. Both communications are dated 12 August 2024 and were received on 19 August 2024.  How can this be remedied and by what date?  ",
            "Answer": "Fees to be paid: Filing fee, online filing + ten page fees: 30% micro-entity reduction Fees for five claims (no reduction) Examination fee with the following sequentially combined reductions: 30% micro-entity reduction 30% reduction if the request for examination is filed in Dutch 75% reduction because the EPO acted as IPEA Designation fee: 30% micro-entity reduction Renewal fee for the third year: 30% micro-entity reduction",
            "AIAnswer": "Answer: To determine the costs associated with entering the European phase for Mr. Tulip's application, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Filing Fee**: Since the application is filed on or after April 1, 2009, an additional fee is payable for applications exceeding 35 pages.\n   \n2. **Additional Fee Calculation**: The additional fee is calculated based on the number of pages over 35.\n\n3. **Language Reduction**: If the requirements of Rule 6(4), Rule 6(6), and Rule 6(7) have been met, the language reduction under Rule 6(3) applies.\n\nGiven the details provided:\n\n- **Description Pages**: 50 pages\n- **Claims Pages**: 20 pages\n\nTotal pages = 50 + 20 = 70 pages\n\nSince the application exceeds 35 pages, an additional fee is required.\n\n### Additional Fee Calculation:\n- Number of pages over 35 = 70 - 35 = 35 pages\n- Additional fee per page = €100 (as per the guidelines)\n\nTherefore, the total additional fee = 35 pages * €100/page = €3,500\n\n### Language Reduction:\n- Since the requirement of Rule 6(4), Rule 6(6), and Rule 6(7) have not been met, the language reduction does not apply.\n\nThus, the total cost for entering the European phase would include the additional fee plus any potential language reduction adjustments, but since they are not applicable here, the primary cost remains the additional fee.\n\n### Conclusion:\nMr. Tulip needs to pay an additional fee of €3,500 for the application to enter the European phase.\nContext: \nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"
