    "2": "Hans filed an admissible notice of opposition against European patent EP-1, which was granted with two independent claims, namely claim 1 and claim 2 relating respectively to two different parts of the patent. The only ground for opposition that he raised was lack of inventive step in respect of claim 1. The opposition is not filed against the patent as a whole, but only against claim 1. In particular, he argued in the notice of opposition that the subject-matter of claim 1 lacked inventive step over the combination of D1 and D2, both published before the effective date of EP-1. Theresa filed third-party observations during the pending opposition proceedings, arguing that claim 2 lacked novelty over D3, a Japanese patent application published before the effective date of EP-1.  For the following statements, assume that the right to be heard of all parties involved has been respected and no amendments have been filed during the opposition proceedings.  For each of the statements 2.1-2.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true or false:  2.1 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 1 lacks novelty over D1, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 for lack of novelty of the subject-matter of claim 1.  2.2 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 2 lacks inventive step over D2 in combination with D3, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 for lack of inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 2 over D2 in combination with D3.  2.3 If the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 1 is not sufficiently disclosed, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 because the subject-matter of claim 1 is not disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art.   2.4 After the opposition division has considered Theresa’s third-party observations, the opposition division may revoke EP-1 based on lack of novelty of the subject-matter of claim 2.",

    "10": "A communication pursuant to Rule 71(3) EPC has been issued for a European patent application. The applicant has fulfilled all the necessary requirements. The related decision to grant a European patent has been despatched on the basis of the documents (Druckexemplar) transmitted to the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC. The mention of the grant of the European patent has been published in the European Patent Bulletin.  However, in the course of the preparation of the publication of the specification of this European patent an error arose, whereby page 2 of the description is missing in the published specification of this European patent.
