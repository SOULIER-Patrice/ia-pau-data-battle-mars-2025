        "Answer": "B",
        "Justification": "Being a natural person, the applicant is entitled to the reduction under Rule 6(3)(b) EPC. Also, the requirement for obtaining the fee reduction is fulfilled, since the request for examination was requested in Spanish at the time of filing (Guidelines A-X, 9.2.3). The reduction as set out in Article 14(1) RFees is 30%."

        "Justification": "In the event of a stay of proceedings all periods other than those for the payment of renewal fees are interrupted (Rule 14(4) EPC, implementing Article 61(1) EPC). The application will lapse if the renewal fees are not paid. If the application has lapsed and it is adjudged that a person other than the applicant is entitled to the grant of the European patent, that person may still file a new European patent application in respect of the same invention under Article 61(1)(b) EPC (G 3/92, headnote)."

        "Justification": "The period begins again on the day on which the proceedings are resumed (Rule 142(4) EPC, implementing Article 120 EPC; Guidelines E-VII, 1.4). However, the new three-month time limit under Rule 82(2) EPC expires during the Easter public holiday, when the EPO is closed. The period is thus extended (Rule 134(1) EPC) until 19 April 2022 (Tuesday)."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Justification": "You should file a request for rectification at the International Bureau with details of the correct inventor. Under Rule 92bis.1(a)(ii) PCT a change in the person, name or address of an inventor can be corrected provided the request is filed before the end of the 30-month period from the priority date (Rule 92bis.1(b) PCT and PCT Applicant's Guide International Phase 11.021).\nUnder the PCT the consent of the person incorrectly designated as inventor is not needed. For a European patent application, the consent of the wrongly designated person is required for correction (Rule 21(1) EPC)."

    "6": {
        "Answer": "A",
        "Justification": "The correct answer is A, because the certificate was not issued at the exhibition. Article 55(1)(b), 55(2) and Rule 25(a) EPC state that the certificate must be issued at the exhibition, so a certificate obtained after an exhibition is not acceptable."

    "7": {
        "Answer": "D",
        "Justification": "The payment is considered to have been made on the date when it is actually entered into an EPO bank account (Article 7(1) RFees). However, it is considered that the period for valid payment has been observed if payment is effected through a bank in a contracting state within the period in which the payment should have been made (Article 7(3) RFees), that is by 18 August 2023 (Friday) at the latest. The EPO may ask the party to provide evidence as to the date on which the payment was effected (Article 7(4) RFees). \nThe current wording of Article 7 RFees applies to payments made on or after 1 April 2020. Before that, if payment was made within the last ten days before expiry of the period, and received after the last day of the period, it was considered that the period had been observed if a surcharge of 10% was paid."

        "Answer": "B",
        "Justification": "The first renewal fee for EP-2 (in respectof the 5th year) must be paid by 2 May 2023 (Tuesday). According to G 3/92 (Reasons 5.4), the filing date of EP-2 will be the filing date of EP-1, i.e. 12 April 2019. EP-2 was filed in the 4th year. According to Article 86(1) and Rule 51(6) EPC no renewal fee for EP-2 needs to be paid in respect of the year in which it was filed or any preceding year. The renewal fee for the 5th year is due (Article 86(1) and Rule 51(1) EPC) on 30 April 2023 (Sunday), which is extended (Article 120 and Rule 134(1) EPC) to 2 May 2023 (Tuesday)."

        "Justification": "In the case of an intervention at the appeal stage only the opposition fee is payable. Payment of the opposition fee is required by Rule 89(2) EPC (implementing Article 105(1) EPC). The EPO has no provisions for requiring the payment of an appeal fee in such cases (G 3/04, Reasons 11).\nThis means that if the notice of intervention is filed during appeal proceedings, the intervener can only obtain status as an opponent and not as an appellant.  He will be party to the appeal proceedings as of right."

        "Justification": "It is permissible to file an opposition in one's own name while acting on behalf of a third party (G 3/97 and G 4/97). The only two situations that might be considered abuse of process would be if the opponent was acting on behalf of the proprietor, company Y, or the opponent was de facto acting as a professional representative without being qualified. Since in this case the attorney is a qualified European patent attorney acting on behalf of company X, this situation does not arise.\nCompany X will not be party to the proceedings so it will be dependent on the representative during opposition proceedings."

    "31": {
        "Answer": "B",
        "Justification": "A change in claim category from a method of operating a device to the device itself, i.e. deleting the “method features” defining therapeutic operation of the device, would broaden the claim and contravene Article 123(3) EPC (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). The features of the pacemaker as defined in the device claim do not depend on the circumstances of its operation, but they did under the terms of the prior method claim (“while a person is exercising”). If the original claim contains the claimed features of the device exhaustively, the change of category may be allowable (Guidelines H-V, 7.3). This condition is not fulfilled. \nMethod features relating to how the pacemaker is installed in and interacts with the human body cannot be converted to device features, amongst other things because an “adapted to” type formulation does not confer the same limitation. For example, a “pressure sensing means adapted to sense the right ventricular systolic pressure” is not limited to such use, since it can e.g. be used to sense the left ventricular systolic pressure (T 82/93, Reasons 2.2 and 2.3)."

    "33": {
        "Answer": "B",
        "Justification": "The fees will be accepted as if they had been paid within the one-month period. This is because it is extremely unlikely that the receiving office will have issued an invitation to pay the fees originally due together with the late payment fee (Rule 16bis.1 PCT) by 11 December 2023 and any payment made before the issue of the invitation is considered to have been made in due time (PCT Applicant's Guide International Phase 5.193 and 5.194)."

Pursuant to Rule 90bis.1 PCT, the applicant may withdraw the international application at any time prior to the expiry of 30 months from the priority date. In the case of multiple applicants, one applicant cannot act on their own. Any withdrawal requires the signature of all the applicants, or that of an agent or common representative who has been explicitly appointed by all the applicants.

The 31-month period expired on 14 October 2023 (Saturday, extended to 16 October 2023). Since the 31-month time limit was not met, the EPO will issue a communication to the applicant under Rule 160(2) EPC and there will be a two-month period for entry into the EPO regional phase using further processing (Article 121(1) and Rule 135 EPC). On 30 October, the client is therefore well within the two-month period for requesting further processing. It is not necessary to wait for the communication to be issued, but the further processing fee must still be paid in addition to the other fees and acts for entry into the EPO regional phase. \nAlternative B is not an option (and would also have been less preferable). It is only possible to withdraw a priority claim in an international application prior to the expiry of 30 months from the (earliest) priority date (Rule 90bis.3(a) PCT)."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Justification": "The correct answer is A, within one month of the expiry of 31 months from the filing date of the priority right to be restored. According to Rule 26bis.2(c)(iii) PCT a priority claim will not be considered void simply because the international application has a filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the filing date is within two months of that date. Consequently, the 31-month period expires 31 months from the priority date to be restored. A period of one month is permitted for filing a request for restoration of priority at the EPO under Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT and Article 22 PCT. Merely fulfilling the requirements of Rule 159(1) earlier than 31 months from the priority date will not change this, as the EPO can only start processing the application before the 31-month time limit if this is expressly requested by the applicant. If the applicant requests early processing and complies with the requirements of Rule 159(1), the effective date of early entry will change, and the time limit for requesting restoration of the priority period will be one month from the effective date (Euro-PCT Guide, 15th edition, 2022, 5.13.022 – 5.13.023; Guidelines E-IX, 2.8.)"

Answer D is also correct. If the priority claim becomes relevant to patentability, a declaration that the European patent application is a complete translation of the priority application may be made instead (Guidelines A-III, 6.8.6). Note that a certified copy of the priority document itself must always be provided, except in those cases where the EPO will include a copy of the previous application without such a request (Guidelines A-III, 6.7). If the previous application is a Chinese, Korean or United States application, the EPO will include a copy of the previous application free of charge if the European patent application was filed before 1 January 2022 or, in the case of a Euro-PCT application that has entered the European phase before that date, if the required priority document can be included in the file of the application by 30 June 2023 (see the notice from the EPO dated 13 November 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A84).

        "Answer": "C",
        "Justification": "Given what we know about the prior art, claim 1 will not be granted as it is not novel, whereas at this point there is no relevant prior art against claim 2. \nIt is too late at the filing of EP1 to claim priority from FP1, since approximately 20 months have passed since FP1 was filed. It is also too late to restore the priority under Article 122 EPC, which would have had to happen no later than two months after the 12-month time limit set by Article 87 (1) EPC.\nFP2 is not a valid priority document for subject-matter A because it was not the first filing for it (Article 87(4) EPC), so the effective date of claim 1 of EP1 is the filing date of EP1.\nFP1 is pending, so it follows that it has been published 18 months after its filing, which is after the filing of FP2 but before the filing of EP1, making it part of the prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for claim 1 in EP1, which is not entitled to priority from FP2.\nThe disclosure of subject-matter A in FP1 takes away the novelty of claim 1 in EP1.\nSubject-matter A+B was disclosed for the first time in FP2, making FP2 the first filing for this subject-matter. The priority claim is therefore valid for A+B. The effective date for claim 2 is before the publication of FP1, so FP1 cannot be cited as prior art against it."
