However, as the application was published on April 12, 2023, this does not apply here. The key points are that representative Y needs to file a change of representative and respond appropriately within the time frame specified.\n\n- **Authorisation signed by the applicant:** Under Rule 75(1) EPC, the authorization from the applicant is required for any changes in representation (see C-II, 2). Hence, it must be filed in good time.\n- **Filing a response to the search report:** The applicant has six months from publication of the extended European search report to respond. In this case, by October 12, 2023, they would have completed that period and need to act promptly.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **B**: This option omits filing an authorisation signed by the applicant which is necessary as per Rule 75(1) EPC. Therefore, this step cannot be bypassed.\n  \n- **C**: The deadline for filing a response to the extended European search report should be 12 October 2023, not 23 October 2023 (six months from publication).

This means that missing the time limit for requesting examination does not necessarily lead to the application being deemed withdrawn; instead, the applicant can make a subsequent request for re-establishment of rights.\n\nExplanation why other choices are incorrect:\n- **Answer A (Time limit for paying the designation fee)**: The context provided does not specifically mention any mechanism for re-establishing rights related to the payment of designation fees. Typically, such fees must be paid on time without provision for extensions or re-establishment procedures.\n  \n- **Answer C (Time limit for filing the application within the priority period)**: The priority period is a specific timeframe in which an applicant has to file their European patent application based on a prior filing date. According to E-VIII, 3.1.1, failure to observe this time limit directly results in loss of the right or means of redress, and there are no provisions mentioned for re-establishment of rights in such cases.\n  \n- **Answer D (Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights)**: The legal text indicates that a request for further processing can be filed to remedy missed time limits but explicitly mentions that fees must be paid. However, this is not an independent 'time limit' that can be re-established; it's part of the process to file such a request.\n\nTherefore, only missing the time limit for requesting examination (Answer B) can potentially be remedied by making a request for further processing according to the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

According to this article, for an international application to be validly filed with the receiving Office (in this case, the DPMA), a power of attorney or some form of authorization must be submitted if representation by someone other than the applicant is necessary. Since Hassan appointed himself to represent Greta and he is not a European patent attorney, submitting a power of attorney signed by Greta would be required for him to act before the EPO as the International Searching Authority.\n\nExplanation for why Answer A is incorrect: The context does not provide any information suggesting that the DPMA (German Patent and Trade Mark Office) can function as the International Searching Authority. Article 12(3) of the PCT stipulates that 'the International Searching Authority shall be a designated or elected office' where the application was filed under the PCT, which in this case would likely be the EPO. Therefore, Hassan cannot represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority for PCT-G.\n\nExplanation for why Answer C is incorrect: The text provided does not mention any requirement for a signature from Greta or Hassan on a demand for international preliminary examination under Article 19 of the PCT. The PCT regulations do require that the application and other required documents be properly filed, but there is no explicit provision stating that a demand must be signed by either party.\n\nExplanation for why Answer D is incorrect: According to the text provided in the PCT Article 34(2), an international application can indeed be withdrawn by the applicant or any person authorized to act on behalf of the applicant. A power of attorney would serve as such authorization, making it possible for Hassan (if properly empowered) or Greta to withdraw the application.

Option B states that both the German firm and the natural person are residents and nationals of Germany, which qualifies them to receive the reduced fee according to Rule 6 EPC.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: This scenario describes an application filed in Spanish by a Spanish European patent attorney for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and has Andorran nationality. Neither Spain nor Andorra is a contracting state with which the EPO grants reduced fees, so this option does not meet the criteria set forth in Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option C**: This describes an application filed in French by a natural person residing in the USA but of Belgian nationality. The United States and Belgium are not contracting states for which fee reductions are granted under Rule 6 EPC. Therefore, this option does not meet the criteria.\n\n- **Option D**: This involves an application filed in Italian by a natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality. Neither the USA nor Switzerland is a contracting state that allows for reduced fees according to Rule 6 EPC. Thus, this scenario also fails to qualify under the given rule.\n\nThe declaration on Form 1001 (crossing the relevant box) pertains only to the eligibility status but does not confer automatic fee reductions; it must be substantiated by the applicant's residency or principal place of business in a contracting state that grants such reductions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, a translation into one of the official languages (English, French, or German) must be filed within two months of the date of filing if an application is originally filed in a language other than an official EPO language. Since Mr Van Holland initially filed EP-parent and then EP-div in Dutch, which is not an official EPO language, he was required to file English translations for both applications.\\n\\nIn the scenario given, although Mr Van Holland requested examination in Dutch and paid all fees due for EP-div, the application still lacks a translation into one of the official languages. Therefore, according to A-III, 6.8.3, if the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent does not provide the translation in time, the right of priority is lost and the applicant or proprietor is informed accordingly.\\n\\nThe correct remedy under Rule 112(1) EPC is that Mr Van Holland can file an English translation within two months of notification of the communication to remediate this deficiency. This aligns with Answer B, making it the correct answer.\\n\\nExplanation for incorrect options:\\n- **Answer A: The deficiency cannot be remedied.**\\nThis is incorrect because there are clear provisions in the guidelines that allow for remedying deficiencies by filing a required translation within the prescribed time limit. As per E-XIII, 4 and A-III, 6.8.3, it’s possible to rectify the situation by timely submission of the necessary documents.\\n\\n- **Answer C: Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP -div together with a request for further processing.**\\nThis option is incorrect because filing a request for further processing alone does not address the deficiency in the language requirement. The Guidelines specifically mandate that a translation be filed within two months, and this must precede any requests for further action.\\n\\n- **Answer D: Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP -div together with a request for re-establishment of rights.**\\nThis option is also incorrect. Re-establishment of rights typically applies in situations where there has been an unintentional delay or non-compliance due to administrative errors, which may not necessarily fit the situation described here. The primary requirement is timely submission of the necessary translation according to Rule 6(1) and A-III, 6.8.3, rather than requesting re-establishment of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

Since the European patent application EP -A was filed on November 16, 2020, the fourth-year renewal fee would be due by November 30, 2024 (one year after the third-year renewal fee payment). However, based on Rule 51(2), this fee can still be paid within six months of the said date provided that an additional fee is also paid. In the context of validating a patent in only two contracting states, there is no special rule mentioned indicating separate payments to each state; thus, the renewal fee would need to be paid centrally.\n\nWhy B is incorrect: Option B suggests November 30, 2023 as the due date for the fourth-year renewal fee. According to Rule 51(1), the correct due date is on or before November 30, 2024, not 2023.\n\nWhy C and D are incorrect: Options C and D both suggest that the renewal fee must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated. The legal text does not provide any such requirement for centralized payment (A and B correctly indicate a central payment to the EPO). Furthermore, while Option C states the valid period until 9 January 2024, which aligns with Rule 51(2) allowing an additional six-month grace period, it incorrectly identifies the correct due date as being within this grace period. In contrast, Option D suggests a later date (16 January 2024), which is beyond the allowed grace period and therefore incorrect.\n\nIn summary, Answer A is correct because the fourth-year renewal fee must be paid centrally to the EPO by November 30, 2024, with an additional six-month grace period allowing it to be validly paid until May 31, 2025. However, for the purposes of this question and based on the provided options, Answer A most closely aligns with the correct due date as per EPC Rule 51(1) and (2).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html"

This includes publishing a new specification, filing translations of the claims where required, and providing a formally typed version of the amended paragraph.\n\n- **Answer A** is correct because it aligns with the requirement to make the document formally compliant. The EPO mandates that upon request, the patent proprietor must pay for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims, and provide a formally compliant version of the entire description including the handwritten amendments.\n\n- **Answer B** is incorrect. Although it mentions that no fee would be required if an appeal is pending, this statement contradicts the legal obligation to ensure formal compliance with the patent documents, regardless of any ongoing appeals.\n\n- **Answer C** is incorrect because the guidelines do not provide for an invitation from the opposition division; rather, they mandate action by the patent proprietor upon receiving notice that amendments are necessary. Thus, 'together with the interlocutory decision' would not include such a formal requirement.\n\n- **Answer D** is also incorrect as it incorrectly states that no appeal filing would lead to this obligation.

This time limit can be derived from understanding how the PCT process works and applying Rule 91 of the PCT Regulations. According to Rule 91(2) of the PCT, 'The time limit referred to in paragraph (1) shall run from the international filing date.' The international filing date is typically set as the earliest priority date for most applications, which aligns with the context provided.\n\nUnder the PCT, an application has a maximum period of 30 months from the earliest priority date to enter into force. Therefore, any rectification request must be made within this timeframe to comply with Rule 91(2).\n\nNow, let's explain why options A (18 months), C (22 months), and D (26 months) are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A (18 months from the earliest priority date)**: The PCT process does not establish an 18-month period for rectifying mistakes in applications. This is shorter than both the standard time limit to enter the national phase and the overall PCT filing deadline, making it unrealistic as a timeframe for such requests.\n\n- **Option C (22 months from the earliest priority date)**: Although this option is closer to the 30-month period, it still does not align with the established rules. The closest approximation of the correct time limit under Rule 91(2) would be 30 months, making 22 months too short.\n\n- **Option D (26 months from the earliest priority date)**: This timeframe is even further away than option C and thus is clearly incorrect based on PCT regulations. It exceeds the maximum period in which an application can enter into force under the PCT system, rendering it impossible for a rectification request to be timely filed within this period.\n\nIn conclusion, B (30 months) is the correct answer as it aligns with the established rules and timeframes under the PCT process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 26, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r26.html\nSource: PCT Rule 91, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r91.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_12.html"

                    "Justification": "Answer B ('Form 1226BB offering the opportunity to comment and file amendments') is correct according to the provided legal text. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO state that 'For Euro-PCT applications where the EPO acted as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and, where a demand under Art. 31 PCT was filed, also as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) or the Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA), the applicant will already have responded to a negative WO-ISA, IPER or supplementary international search report prepared by the EPO' (C-II, 3.2). This implies that when amendments were filed in response to the negative written opinion issued as ISA, it was done voluntarily and within the international phase. Upon entry into the regional phase, the applicant will receive Form 1226BB, which offers them an opportunity to further respond by filing comments or amendments.\n\nExplanation of incorrect options:\n- Answer A ('Form 1226AA; if you do not reply to it in time, the application will be deemed to be withdrawn') is incorrect. There is no mention of Form 1226AA in the provided text and its reference to a withdrawal does not align with the scenario where amendments have already been filed.\n- Answer C ('Form 1226CC offering the opportunity to file amendments before the supplementary European search report is drawn up') is incorrect because this form would typically be relevant when there is an International Preliminary Examination, which is not indicated in the provided context. The applicant has only responded to a negative written opinion and no demand under Art. 31 PCT was filed.\n- Answer D ('Form 1226AC stating that the examination has started') is incorrect because it suggests the start of national phase processing at the EPO, which would not occur if there was no demand for an International Preliminary Examination (IPEA) and the application had already moved into the regional phase. The text indicates that further amendments or comments may still be required as per Rule 161(1), but it does not indicate a start of examination at this stage.\n\nIn conclusion, only Answer B accurately reflects the scenario described in the context provided by the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_5.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the information in the provided legal texts and case law, the applicant can choose the USPTO as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and the EPO as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). This is correct because under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), applicants have the flexibility to designate which offices will perform the searching and examination. Therefore, option B stating that 'The applicant can choose the USPTO as ISA and the EPO as IPEA' is accurate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests choosing the EPO as the ISA and the USPTO as the IPEA, which reverses their roles in this context. The correct designations are provided by option B.\n\nOption C is also incorrect as there's no information or legal basis given to suggest that the Austrian Patent Office can be chosen as either an ISA or IPEA for a PCT application designating 'EP.'\n\nOption D incorrectly pairs the EPO with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) instead of USPTO. The EPO is designated in the context of European patent applications, while IPOS would not typically be involved in this process unless specifically agreed upon by all parties, which is not indicated here.\n\nThe legal basis for this conclusion comes from the Patent Cooperation Treaty and its guidelines, particularly concerning how applicants can designate offices to act as ISA and IPEA. The text does not provide any specific information that would preclude the choice of USPTO or EPO in these roles, making B the correct answer while A, C, and D are incorrect based on standard PCT procedures.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (A-III, 6.6), where a priority claim's date precedes the European patent application’s filing date by more than twelve months, the applicant may be informed that their priority claim is considered invalid unless they indicate a corrected date within the twelve-month period preceding the filing date or request re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period and this request is subsequently granted. However, these provisions only apply if the European patent application was also filed within the two-month period starting from the expiry of the priority period.\n\nIn this case, the applicant P validly filed an international patent application (PCT-P) on 20 June 2023, which claimed priority from EP-I filed on 7 July 2022. The missing priority claim from EP-II, filed on 3 July 2022, would be considered invalid by the EPO's Receiving Section unless P either:\n\n1. Indicated a corrected date within the twelve-month period preceding the filing date of PCT-P (i.e., up to 20 June 2024), or\n2. Requested re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period and had this request subsequently granted.\n\nSince today is 12 October 2023, which falls within a period much earlier than the twelve-month validity window for PCT-P (20 June 2024) as well as the two-month period starting from the expiry of EP-II’s priority period (31 August 2023), the applicant has not missed the deadline to add the missing priority claim.\n\n**Explanation why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A:** This is incorrect because it suggests a time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 3 November 2023, which is beyond the valid period. As established, the relevant deadlines are based on the filing date of PCT-P (20 June 2024) and the two-month period from EP-II’s expiry (31 August 2023).\n\n- **Option C:** This is incorrect as it indicates a deadline for adding the priority claim expires on 20 October 2023, which is too early. The relevant deadlines are based on the filing date of PCT-P and not earlier than that.\n\n- **Option D:** This is incorrect because it states that the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023, which is irrelevant to the situation as the application was filed much later (20 June 2023). The relevant period starts from the filing date of PCT-P and not the date EP-II was filed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

                    "Answer": "D",
                    "Justification": "Answer D ('None of the above') is the correct answer because there is no indication in the given legal context that any of the actions proposed in options A, B, or C are required under the circumstances described. The provided case law and guidelines do not mention scenarios where a request for an extension (Option A), payment of fees for further processing (Option B), or filing a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights (Option C) is necessary.\n\nAccording to the context:\n- **Case Law III, Q.1.2** discusses the continuation of opposition proceedings after the patent has lapsed or been surrendered, but it does not pertain to situations involving appeals and comments beyond those periods.\n- **Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6** explains that parties (opponents, interveners) who withdraw their opposition remain as parties only until the date of such withdrawal. It also mentions third parties presenting observations but do not become part of the proceedings unless they file an opposition or intervene.\n- **Case Law III, Q.1.2.1 and 1.2.2** focus on scenarios involving continuation of proceedings by opponents and patent proprietors during opposition appeal processes. In these cases, the boards have discretion to continue proceedings based on specific requests.\n\nThe scenario presented involves an opponent/ respondent filing comments within a period provided after receiving communication from the board. This is within the time frame allowed for filing comments as communicated by the board in its letter dated 1 June 2023. The opponent/ respondent has timely acted and no further action as suggested in options A, B, or C is required.\n\nTherefore, none of these actions (A, B, C) are necessary based on the provided context.

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B because Rule 51(1) of EPC states that for a European patent application in respect of the coming year, renewal fees may be paid up to six months before they fall due. Specifically, it mentions that 'the renewal fee in respect of the third year may not be validly paid more than six months before it falls due,' and all other renewal fees (which would include the fourth year) may not be paid more than three months before they fall due.\n\nThe application was filed on 20 March 2020. The third-year renewal fee, therefore, falls due one year after the filing date, i.e., by 20 March 2021. Thus, as of 12 October 2023 (the day when proceedings were resumed), payment can be made without an additional fee up to six months before it was due, which is until 20 March 2024.\n\nWhy B is correct:\n- According to the rules provided in EPC Rule 51(1) and its amendments, renewal fees for the third year may be paid up to six months before they fall due. Since the third-year fee was due by 20 March 2024, payment can still be made without an additional fee until 20 March 2024.\n\nWhy A is incorrect:\n- Option A states that 'as no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.' This statement is incorrect because Rule 51 does not provide for such a consequence; rather, it specifies deadlines for payment and penalties if payments are late. The application would only be deemed withdrawn under other provisions of the EPC.\n\nWhy C is incorrect:\n- Option C suggests that renewal fees can be paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest. While this timing fits within the six-month period, Rule 51(2) allows for payment without any additional fee up to the due date (20 March 2024), which is earlier than 30 April 2024.\n\nWhy D is incorrect:\n- Option D claims that renewal fees can be paid by 31 October 2023. This option is incorrect because it suggests payment before the third-year fee was even due (20 March 2024). The application's resumption on 12 October 2023 does not change the date when the fee would have fallen due.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "Answer B is correct because, according to the guidelines, for an international application entering the European phase, the applicant needs to complete and file Form 1200 and pay certain fees. The search report has already been published by CNIPA (China National Intellectual Property Administration), so the filing of a request for early processing is not necessary according to Rule 70(2). The relevant steps are as follows:\n\n- Filing Form 1200: This form needs to be completed and filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) as part of entering the EP phase.\n- Payment of Fees: The applicant should pay:\n  - Filing Fee: To formally enter the national phase in Europe.\n  - Search Fee: As the search report has already been issued by CNIPA, a fee is due for this service.\n  - Renewal Fee for the Third Year: This is mandatory to maintain the application during its third year of life.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while completing and filing Form 1200 and paying the filing and search fees are correct actions, there is no need to pay only these two. The renewal fee for the third year must also be paid according to EPO rules.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because completing and filing Form 1200, paying the filing and search fees, and appointing a representative are not all necessary actions in this scenario. Appointing a representative (if none has been appointed already) would typically be done separately from the initial entry into the EP phase.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because option B correctly identifies the required actions based on the context provided by the legal guidelines, so it cannot be 'None of the above statements.'\n\nIn conclusion, Answer B reflects all necessary actions for the CN applicant to take upon entering the European phase 25 months after the filing date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_5.html"

In this scenario, the applicant noticed that the renewal fee was not yet due and should not be debited on 10 October 2024. The debit order to CFP for the renewal fee is scheduled to be executed on 18 October 2024.\n\nThe legal text does not explicitly mention a deadline for revoking such orders, but considering standard banking practices and the need for prompt correction of errors, it is reasonable to infer that the applicant would have until just before the execution date (i.e., by 17 October 2024) to revoke or modify the debit order.

This option allows the applicant to remedy the situation by requesting further processing and paying the prescribed fee. Option A (File a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision) is incorrect because the guidelines do not mention an appeals process for failing to file a designation of inventor on time, which would typically be handled as a matter related to compliance with procedural requirements rather than substantive grounds for appeal. Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor) is also incorrect. The 'Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1' state that failure to observe time limits must have direct consequences such as refusal or revocation and does not mention a specific provision for re-establishment of rights for unobserved time limits related to oppositions or designations of inventor. Option D (A, B and C are correct) is incorrect because only option B accurately reflects the available remedy based on the provided legal context.

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, when an applicant receives a communication from the search division indicating that unity of invention has not been complied with, they are invited to pay additional search fees if they want the search to cover other inventions beyond those first mentioned in the claims (see F-V, 3.4). The text states clearly that “Together with this invitation, the applicant will receive a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims (for information only) and the reasons for the non-unity findings.” This means that while the provisional opinion is provided for informational purposes only and does not need to be responded to by the applicant, it must still be acknowledged. \n\n**Why A is Incorrect:**\nAnswer A suggests a specific date (25 October 2024) within which additional search fees must be paid. However, the Guidelines do not provide a set deadline but indicate that the time limit for responding to such an invitation should be followed. The exact period can vary based on EPO practice and is typically communicated with the communication from the search division.\n\n**Why C is Incorrect:**\nAnswer C implies that paying additional search fees under protest requires payment of protest fees within the same time frame. According to the Guidelines, there is no requirement for filing a protest or paying any associated fee if you decide to pay the additional search fees. The focus is on whether the applicant wants to proceed with the additional search by paying the required fees.\n\n**Why D is Incorrect:**\nAnswer D states that failure to pay additional search fees will result in the international patent application being deemed withdrawn. According to B-VII, 1.2, if the applicant does not respond within the time limit set for replying to the invitation to pay further search fees, no decision will be made on whether the application is continued or withdrawn based solely on this non-payment. The applicant has a chance to complete the payment and continue with the process as long as it is done before the deadline.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

This is clearly stated in the guidelines for file inspection under 'Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.1,' where it mentions that a certified copy can be issued upon request if the conditions for file inspection are met.\n\n**Explanation of why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option B**: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau is not mentioned in the provided legal text as a means to obtain a certified copy. The guidelines do not indicate that the International Bureau can directly access or request documents from national offices through this mechanism for obtaining certified copies.\n\n- **Option C**: Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO would typically require specific procedures and agreements between the EPO and the national office, which are not detailed in the provided context. The guidelines do not suggest that individuals can directly file such a copy without the national office's involvement.\n\n- **Option D**: While it is true that the International Bureau handles the PCT process, the text does not provide any indication that submitting a certified copy to the International Bureau would be an appropriate method for obtaining one from a national office like Luxembourg. The guidelines emphasize interaction with the national office (Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office) for obtaining such documents.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

This aligns with the legal texts provided:\n\n- **Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (D-VIII, 1.2.1):** If the opposition division considers at least one ground of opposition valid, it will revoke the patent under Article 101(2) or 101(3)(b) of the European Patent Convention.\n- **Case Law III, Q.1.2:** This case law indicates that an opponent may file an appeal against the decision if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of the opposition proceedings.\n\nTherefore, Answer A is correct because it accurately reflects these legal provisions where Firm B (as one of the parties to the opposition proceedings) has a right to appeal the opposition division's revocation decision. \n\n**Why Other Answers Are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Answer B:** This option incorrectly states that the opposition division decided to revoke the patent, which is not necessarily correct without additional information.\n  \n- **Answer C:** This answer suggests that Firm C (a third party) can file an appeal against the decision. However, the guidelines and case law provided do not support this. A third party's observations cannot lead to a direct appeal; only parties directly involved in the proceedings such as the patent proprietor or the opponent have the right to appeal.\n\n- **Answer D:** This option is incorrect because it incorrectly states that Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings. The given context does not provide any information about withdrawals by Firm B, and instead focuses on the outcome of the opposition and appeals rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html"

The mention of grant was published on 2 October 2024, and the unitary effect had been registered on the same date; however, this registration does not affect the timing for paying renewal fees. Since Rule 51 specifies that renewal fees are due one month after the anniversary of filing (which is 31 October), option B correctly identifies when the fee becomes due.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A suggests a renewal fee still has to be paid by 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year for EP -X. This statement is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the application was divided, and each divisional application (like EP -X-C0) starts its own term from the date of filing, which is different from the original application.\n- Option C states a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 6th year for EP -X-C0. This statement is incorrect because it incorrectly identifies the year as the sixth instead of the fifth, and the correct date based on Rule 51(1) is one month before this date (31 October).\n- Option D suggests no renewal fee has to be paid on 31 October 2024. This statement is incorrect because Rule 51 clearly states that a renewal fee for the fifth year must be paid within the specified timeframe, which in this case would be by 31 October 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html"

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mention that various functionalities can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio, including filing via the EPO’s online filing software eOLF (which corresponds to 'filing via the EPO's Online Filing 2.0') and accessing a mailbox service (corresponding to 'Mailbox'). Additionally, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to infer that users can perform patent searches using servers managed by the EPO.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- Option A ('A shared area with examiners, European Patent Register, filing via the EPO's online filing software eOLF') includes a 'shared area with examiners' which is not mentioned in the provided context. While it’s possible that such an area exists, the text does not specifically reference this feature.\\n- Option B ('Mailbox, a shared area with examiners, replying to a communication under Article 94(3) EPC') includes 'a shared area with examiners,' which is not mentioned in the provided context. Moreover, while users may indeed reply to communications under Article 94(3) EPC (which deals with examination procedures), this specific functionality is not explicitly linked to MyEPO Portfolio as per the given text.\\n- Option C ('Mailbox, patent search via publication server, a shared area with examiners') includes 'a shared area with examiners,' which again is not mentioned in the provided context.

This can be inferred from the necessity of using such contingency measures during exceptional circumstances where the regular processes are unavailable.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Answer A**: The Guidelines do not specify that submitting documents after business hours necessitates the use of a Contingency Upload Service. They only provide recommendations for timely filing and forwarding, but they don't explicitly mention this specific service as being used for late submissions.\n- **Answer B**: While technical issues at your end might delay submission, the guidelines recommend using the EPO Contingency Upload Service in situations where there is a system outage at the EPO. If you are experiencing a technical issue at your end but the EPO systems are functioning correctly, this would not typically require using the contingency service.\n- **Answer D**: The Guidelines do not suggest that the use of a Contingency Upload Service should be contingent on the EPO being closed due to an official holiday. Holidays and system outages are treated differently; holidays generally don't affect the operation of the standard filing systems, whereas outages might necessitate alternative methods like the contingency service.\n\nThus, Answer C is correct as it aligns with the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO regarding the appropriate use of the Contingency Upload Service during system outages.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 3.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_3_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_4.html"

This principle also applies to Euro-PCT applications designating EP. Therefore, option B states that an international application filed with the EPO in French can be processed using PCT Direct if the subsequent international application is filed in English, which aligns with these guidelines since English or French are accepted as filing languages.\n\nAnswer A: Incorrect because it specifies a Belgian application, and there is no restriction mentioned regarding national applications like Belgian ones in the provided text. The key criterion for PCT Direct availability is the language of the initial application (priority) and subsequent international application being among the accepted languages (English or French).\n\nAnswer C: Incorrect as per the legal context which states that a Euro-PCT application must be filed in English, French, or German to qualify for inclusion in the state of the art. This option incorrectly suggests an international application filed in English can still proceed with PCT Direct if the subsequent application is also in English.\n\nAnswer D: While it's good practice to file amended claims as part of a PCT Direct letter, there is no explicit requirement mentioned in the provided text that amended claims must be included for processing under PCT Direct. Therefore, this statement could be considered NOT correct based on the given context. However, since we are asked to identify which statement is not correct and option B fits more closely with the legal guidelines provided, answer D might also be viewed as a less strict requirement rather than an absolute non-compliance.\n\nTo summarize, Answer A and C directly contradict the accepted languages mentioned in G-IV, 5.2, while Answer D is not necessarily incorrect but is not required according to the provided text.
