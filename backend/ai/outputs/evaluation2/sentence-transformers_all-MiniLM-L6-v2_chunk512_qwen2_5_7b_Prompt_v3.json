Since there are no proceedings pending against the patent at this point (as no opposition was filed), Ms Smith could be deleted as an inventor based on a written request from the patent proprietor.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Option B suggests that \"Ms Smith can no longer be deleted as inventor because no proceedings are pending before the EPO.\" This statement is inaccurate because the legal basis does not impose any restriction on correcting the inventor's name when there are no opposition proceedings. The fact that no opposition was filed does not preclude the patent proprietor from rectifying errors in the inventor's designation.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Option C states \"The patent proprietor can request that Ms Smith be deleted as inventor but needs Mr Li's consent for this.\" This option incorrectly assumes that Mr Li, who might or might not be the sole inventor, needs to give consent. The legal basis provided does not mention any requirement for consent from a co-inventor; it only requires a written request by the patent proprietor.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Option D states \"Ms Smith can only be deleted as inventor with her consent.\" This statement contradicts the legal content, which allows for the correction to be made upon a written request by the patent proprietor without requiring any form of consent from Ms Smith.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, C.2.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_2_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 1.2.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_1_2_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.3.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_3_7.html"

According to E-VII, 1.4, a change of representative must be formally requested, and an authorisation from the applicant is necessary.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it omits the requirement that Y should file an authorisation signed by the applicant, which is crucial under Article 137 EPC as per E-VII, 1.4.\n- Option C is incorrect because it sets a later deadline (23 October 2023) for filing the response to the extended European search report, which would be after the statutory deadline of 12 October 2023.

Since Hassan is not required to have such authorization specifically for this task, and Greta could sign it directly, this statement is misleading.\n\n- **Option D is correct**: The provision allows an international application to be withdrawn only by the applicant (or their duly appointed representative) through a written request, which aligns with PCT Article 49. Thus, it is not mandatory that the withdrawal must always come from the applicant or a power of attorney holder.\n\n- **Option A is incorrect**: According to PCT Article 16, the International Searching Authority (ISA) can be either a national Office or an intergovernmental organization.

The renewal fee for the fourth year cannot be directly linked to the initial filing date since you are only validating the patent in two contracting states, not granting it.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Option C states that the renewal fee must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated. However, this is contrary to EPC Rule 51, which specifies that the renewal fees can be paid centrally if validation occurs in multiple states. Additionally, C incorrectly mentions a payment period until 9 January 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Like option C, D also suggests paying separately in each state, which is not correct according to Rule 51.

The information does not provide specific preferences for ISAs or IPEAs based on national boundaries.\n\n- Therefore, the correct answer is **Answer: A** because it directly aligns with the given choices and options without any additional restrictions specified in the legal content.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- According to Article 88(1) EPC, an applicant desiring to take advantage of the priority of a previous application shall file a declaration of priority and any other document required in accordance with the Implementing Regulations. The footnote references clarify that the Act revising the European Patent Convention of 29 November 2000 governs this process.\n\n- For the missing priority claim from EP-II filed on 3 July 2022, under EPC Article 88(1), the time limit for adding a priority claim to an international application that was filed after the European applications' filing dates but before the publication of their contents is determined by Rule 45(2) PCT. The PCT rule indicates that the time limit is six months from the earliest claimed priority date, which in this case is 3 July 2022.\n\n- Therefore, the deadline for adding the priority claim from EP-II to the international application PCT-P would be six months from 3 July 2022, extending until 3 January 2023. However, considering that applicant P filed on 20 June 2023, the relevant period is recalculated based on the actual filing date of the current international application.\n\n- Since applicant P validly filed PCT-P on 20 June 2023 and needs to claim priority from EP-II filed on 3 July 2022, the six-month time limit would be calculated from 20 June 2023. Six months from 20 June 2023 is 20 December 2023. However, considering today's date is 12 October 2023, the remaining period for adding this priority claim is six months minus approximately two months and two weeks, which would extend until 3 November 2023.\n\n- Options B, C, and D are incorrect:\n    - **Option B** suggests a deadline of 7 November 2023. This is not correct as the calculation should be from the filing date of PCT-P on 20 June 2023.\n    - **Option C** suggests a deadline of 20 October 2023, which has already passed and does not align with EPC Article 88(1) or Rule 45(2) PCT.\n    - **Option D** incorrectly states that the time limit expired on 3 July 2023. This is inaccurate as the six-month period starts from the filing date of the current international application, which was on 20 June 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

Since the opponent/ respondent filed comments after the four-month period, they need to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no indication in the provided legal content that the opponent/ respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing simply because their response was late. The specific requirement for payment only applies to reestablishment of rights (Option C).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The opponent/ respondent does not need to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee, as they have merely missed the deadline for filing comments but can still rectify this by requesting an extension.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since Options A and B are valid courses of action that must be taken in this scenario, Option D cannot be correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Option A is correct because no renewal fees have been paid, which means that under Rule 51(2) EPC, the application will be deemed withdrawn if the fees are not paid by their respective deadlines. Since three patent years have already passed (from filing on 20 March 2020 to now), and assuming the current date is within a reasonable time frame after the third year ends, the application would have been deemed withdrawn as no renewal fee was paid during these periods.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it suggests that the fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest. However, based on Rule 51(2) EPC, an additional fee must be paid if the renewal fee is not paid by the last day of the respective year.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because it suggests that the fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest. This exceeds the deadline stated in Rule 51(2) EPC, which limits the payment period to within two months from the end of the respective year.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest. This is also outside the allowable timeframe as per Rule 51(2) EPC, which specifies that payment must occur within two months from the end of the respective year, i.e., no later than 31 March 2024 for the fourth-year renewal fee.\n\nThus, A correctly identifies the application's status due to non-payment of renewal fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

The search fee is also required as per Rule 159(1)(e).\n\n- **B. Complete and file Form 1200 and pay the filing fee, the search fee and the renewal fee for the third year**: This statement is incorrect because there is no mention of a need to pay a renewal fee in this context; it only refers to actions that are required upon entry into the EP phase.\n\n- **C. Complete and file Form 1200, pay the filing fee and the search fee and appoint a representative**: While appointing a representative can be important, there is no legal requirement for it to be done specifically in this scenario. The decision to appoint a representative depends on whether the applicant chooses to have professional representation.\n\n- **D. None of the above statements**: This statement is incorrect because option A accurately reflects the actions required by the applicant as per Rule 159, EPC, given the conditions mentioned (publication after 18 months with no priority claimed).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report, as this is when the designation fee must be paid under Rule 39 EPC in force from April 1, 2009.\n\n- Option B (Date of mention of the publication of the European search report) is incorrect because it does not provide a sufficient window for withdrawing the application to obtain a refund. According to Article VI, Section 2.5, the designation fee needs to be paid within six months after this date; thus, merely mentioning the publication does not enable an immediate withdrawal.\n\n- Option C (The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded) is incorrect because it ignores the potential for a refund if the application is withdrawn before the deadline. Rule 11 of the Fees Regulations states that a refund may be obtained under certain circumstances, particularly when the application is withdrawn within the specified period.\n\n- Option D (Date of the start of substantive examination) is not relevant to the designation fee payment and withdrawal process. The start of substantive examination does not affect when the designation fee must be paid or the possibility of withdrawing an application for a refund.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

In this case, the execution date is 18 October 2024, so the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee is 17 October 2024.\n\n- Option A (10 October 2024) is incorrect because the applicant has already noticed that the renewal fee should not be debited and there would have been ample time before the execution date to make changes. The correct period for revocation according to the ADA provision is up until one day before the execution date.\n\n- Option C (18 October 2024) is incorrect because, as per the ADA regulation, any revocation must be made before the specified execution date; otherwise, it would not be considered a valid request for revocation. \n\n- Option D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part) is incorrect because the legal content clearly states that partial revocation of a debit order is possible until one day before the execution date.

Since the Receiving Section issued a refusal dated 10 October 2024, the applicant can file a notice of appeal within four months from this date.\n\n- **Option B (File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision)**: Rule 69 EPC provides that in certain circumstances, an applicant may request further processing. However, it does not provide for a specific time limit like option C does. The correct provision here is likely to be Article 122 EPC (re-establishment of rights), which has its own specific timing and conditions.\n\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor)**: According to Article 122 EPC, an applicant can request re-establishment of their rights if they were unable to observe a time limit despite due care. This is valid as long as the conditions of Article 122 are met and the application is filed within two months after notification.\n\n- **Option D (A, B and C are correct)**: Since all three actions—appealing the decision, requesting further processing (which should be rephrased to match Article 122), and requesting re-establishment of rights—are valid remedies under EPC rules, option D is the most comprehensive.\n\nTherefore, the applicant has multiple options available to remedy the situation as outlined in A, B, and C.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_9.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: EPC Article 122, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a122.html"

Additionally, Rule 114(1) EPC requires that such observations be filed in an official language of the European Patent Office.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because according to Article 115 and Rule 114 EPC, third parties filing observations are not considered parties to the proceedings, and there is no obligation for applicants to respond to these observations. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO further state that \"the applicant may respond but is not obliged to do so.\"\n\n- Option B is incorrect because although it states that observations must be filed in writing, it incorrectly claims that they cannot be filed anonymously. According to Article 115 and Rule 114(1) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, third-party observations may indeed be filed anonymously.\n\n- Option C is incorrect as there is no requirement to pay an official fee for filing third-party observations. Moreover, while it states that a statement of grounds on which the observation is based must be included, it incorrectly implies this is a condition for consideration by the examining division. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO clarify that if the observations relate to alleged prior art available other than from a document, e.g., use, they are considered only if the facts stated are either not disputed or established beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to EPC Rule 64(1), if the European Patent Office considers that a European patent application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention, it must draw up a partial search report and inform the applicant that for the European search report to cover the other inventions, additional search fees must be paid within two months. The communication was received on 25 September 2024, so the deadline for paying the additional fees is 25 November 2024. However, since the question specifically mentions a time limit of 25 October 2024 (likely due to a typographical error in the question), this is still within the correct period as per EPC Rule 64(1).\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: According to EPC Rule 64, you are required to pay the additional search fees. Additionally, since the ISA has issued a provisional opinion, you should also respond by either paying the fees or providing a response.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: While you can file your protest under EPC Rule 97(2), this does not mean that you have to pay two protest fees if you pay additional search fees. The Enlarged Board of Appeal's decision G 1/11 (Annex I) suggests that the protest fee mechanism may vary, but it is not mandatory to file a protest with the payment of the search fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: According to EPC Rule 64(2), you can request a refund if you pay additional fees under protest and later find the communication unjustified. Therefore, non-payment within the time limit does not automatically mean the application will be deemed withdrawn; it would simply result in no search report being issued for those inventions not covered by any paid fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

This is a standard procedure that aligns with the requirements for filing a priority claim.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect**: The Digital Access Service (DAS) is mentioned in \"Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2\" as used by the European Patent Office to obtain certified copies of applications from other offices. However, it pertains specifically to internal EPO procedures and not directly to requesting a certified copy from the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: While \"Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2\" discusses the form and content of priority documents as determined by the EPO President, it does not allow applicants to file their own certified copies directly with the EPO for a priority claim without the necessary verification or preparation from the office that originally filed the Luxembourg patent application.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: The International Bureau (IB) mentioned in \"Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2\" typically refers to the World Intellectual Property Organization's International Bureau which handles PCT applications and their priority claims but does not directly handle national or regional applications in this context. Thus, filing a certified copy with the International Bureau is not a correct procedure as per the guidelines provided for claiming priority within the EPO system.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct action to file a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application for this international patent application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

According to the legal content provided in **Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1**, if the opposition division decides that the European patent and its invention meet the requirements of the EPC after considering any amendments made during the opposition proceedings, it issues a decision to maintain the European patent as amended.\n\n- Option B is correct because at the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted. According to Article 101(3)(a) and Rule 82(1), an appeal can be filed against such a decision by anyone who participated in the opposition proceedings, which includes Firm B.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because Firm C did not participate in the opposition proceedings; they only submitted observations under Art. 115 EPC. According to **Case Law and Guidelines**, only parties who participated in the opposition can appeal the final decision of the opposition division.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because during the opposition proceedings, Firm B withdrew its opposition, meaning it no longer had standing as a party involved in the proceedings. Therefore, Firm B would not be entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision according to Article 103(2) and Rule 104 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Option A is incorrect**: According to EPC Article 76(1) in conjunction with Rule 51(3), renewal fees for a divisional application are due from the date of filing, which is October 1, 2020. For EP -X-C0 (the unitary effect version), the fifth year's renewal fee would be due on October 31, 2024.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect**: The mention of grant for EP -X was published on October 2, 2024, which means that the first full year of the patent starts from this date. Therefore, the fifth year's renewal fee (for the original application) would be due on October 31, 2025.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: Since the unitary effect version EP -X-C0 has been registered with a grant publication date of October 2, 2024, the first full year for this patent starts from this date. Thus, the fifth year's renewal fee should be due on October 31, 2025.\n\n- **Option C is correct**: The unitary effect version EP -X-C0 starts its term from the publication of grant, which is October 2, 2024. Therefore, the sixth year’s renewal fee would indeed fall due by October 31, 2025. As per EPC Article 86(1) and Rule 51(3), the time limits for paying the renewal fees are calculated from the filing date of the earlier (parent) application or root application in case of a sequence of divisional applications.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C: A renewal fee is due on October 31, 2024 in respect of the 6th year for EP -X-C0.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

In cases where delivery exceeds seven days after the date of posting, the period expires later by the number of extra days.\n\nThe communication setting the four-month time limit was dated 12 September 2024 and was received by the applicant on 21 September 2024, nine days later. According to Rule 126(2), since the delivery exceeded seven days (9 - 7 = 2 extra days), the period for replying would expire 2 days after the standard four-month duration.\n\nCalculating this, a four-month time limit from 12 September 2024 is approximately until 13 January 2025. Adding two extra days due to late delivery gives us 15 January 2025, but since the options provided are based on 12 January (the last business day of the four-month period), the correct answer is 13 January 2025.\n\n- Option B: 12 January 2025 would be incorrect as it does not account for the two extra days due to late delivery.\n- Option C: 22 January 2025 incorrectly extends the deadline by an additional ten days beyond what is legally required.\n- Option D: 14 January 2025 also exceeds the legally calculated deadline.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html"

The context provided does not discuss time constraints or out-of-hours services.\n  \n- Option B is incorrect because if the EPO's systems are functioning correctly, it implies that standard filing methods can be used, and thus there would be no need to use the contingency service when technical issues at your end occur.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because the legal content does not provide any information about using the service when the EPO is closed due to an official holiday.

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO state that if an application was filed in a non-official language of the European Patent Office (EPO), an appropriate translation must be submitted in one or more of those languages.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because it requires a double submission—a claim in Finnish and then again in English—which is not necessary according to the rules. The applicant can provide the claims initially in the non-official language but must ensure that a proper translation is provided promptly as required by Rule 71(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the EPO.\n\n- Option B is partially correct but overly broad; it does not specify which official language the translation should be submitted into. Since English, being one of the official languages of the EPO, was already provided in this scenario, an additional translation into any other official language would not be necessary or required by these rules.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because there is no prohibition against filing amended claims initially in Finnish if a timely and accurate translation is subsequently provided. The key point is compliance with the translation requirement set out in Rule 71(3) of the Rules of Procedure for the EPO, which permits the use of non-official languages subject to prompt submission of translations.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"
