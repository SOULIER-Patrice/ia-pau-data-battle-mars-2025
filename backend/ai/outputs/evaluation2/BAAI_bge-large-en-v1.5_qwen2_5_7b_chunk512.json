The patent proprietor would need to file a request in writing for Ms Smith to be deleted as an inventor, which aligns with answer A.\n\nOption B is incorrect because Rule 21(1) of the Guidelines allows rectification of incorrect designation even after proceedings before the EPO are terminated, meaning that no opposition being filed does not prevent such changes from occurring. \n\nOption C is incorrect since it suggests that Mr Li's consent would be necessary for deleting Ms Smith as an inventor. According to Rule 21(1) and A-III, 5.5, only the consent of the wrongly designated person (in this case, Ms Smith) is required, not the previously designated inventors.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it states that Ms Smith's consent would be needed for her deletion as an inventor. The legal text explicitly mentions that rectification can occur with the consent of the patent's applicant or proprietor where the request is not filed by them (the patent proprietor in this case), and also requires the wrongly designated person’s consent, but does not stipulate that she must also give her own consent for the deletion to proceed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_4.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6_2.html"

Without this authorization, the change in representation would be invalid.\n  \n- Option C is incorrect as it has the response deadline extended to October 23, 2023, which exceeds the six-month period required (until April 12, 2024) after publication of the EESR.

This is applicable because the failure to request examination within the prescribed period can be considered a procedural issue that may affect patent prosecution.\n\n- **A. Time limit for paying the designation fee**: According to the provided text, missed time limits related to payment of fees are typically fixed and not remediable through re-establishment of rights (see E-VIII, 1.1). The correct procedure would involve timely payment or seeking an extension if eligible.\n- **C. Time limit for filing the application within the priority period**: The priority period is a critical time frame that must be strictly adhered to; missed deadlines here cannot be corrected by re-establishment of rights (see E-VIII, 1.1 and J26/95 on procedural acts).\n- **D. Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights**: This option is incorrect because it’s not a time limit that can be missed; rather, it's a cost associated with requesting re-establishment of rights.

Typically, ISA functions are carried out by patent offices of PCT member states.\\n\\n- **Option B**: Correct. According to Rule 81(4) of the EPC Implementing Regulations, if an international application is filed with the EPO acting as ISA, a power of attorney must be submitted for the agent representing the applicant before the EPO (Art. 26(3) EPC). Since Hassan is not a European patent attorney but represents Greta in Germany, he would indeed need to submit a properly signed power of attorney.\\n\\n- **Option C**: Incorrect. The provisions of the PCT do not specify that the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by either the applicant or an appointed agent; it only mandates that the application should contain such a request (PCT Art. 34(1)). Greta, as the applicant, could indeed sign this demand, but it is not strictly required to be signed by Hassan.\\n\\n- **Option D**: Incorrect. According to PCT Article 28, an international application can be withdrawn by the applicant or any other party authorized in writing by the applicant (PCT Art. 28(1)).

Therefore, this option does not qualify under Rule 6 EPC.\n- **Option B:** A firm with its principal place of business in Germany and a natural person resident in Germany filing a European patent application in Dutch do not meet the criteria because both the firm and individual are residents of a country that is an EU member state (Germany), which disqualifies them under Rule 6 EPC.\n- **Option D:** A natural person residing in the USA with Swiss nationality filing a European patent application in Italian does not qualify. Although Italian can be used as one of the admissible non-EPO languages, the applicant must be an individual or legal entity established in a country that is not a member state (Swiss nationals are generally considered to have their main residence and nationality tied to Switzerland, which is an EU member state).

This corresponds to Form 1226BB as it serves the purpose of inviting comments and amendments.\n\n**Why B is correct:**\n- The Guidelines explicitly state that a communication should include an invitation for the applicant to file comments, correct deficiencies, and submit amendments.\n- This aligns with the scenario where no international preliminary examination was requested and only Form 1200 (which does not require further amendments) has been used.\n\n**Why A is incorrect:**\n- Form 1226AA refers specifically to cases where an application is deemed withdrawn if the applicant fails to reply, which is not the primary function of the communication in this scenario.\n- It does not address the situation where comments and amendments are invited by the EPO as part of the examination process.\n\n**Why C is incorrect:**\n- Form 1226CC pertains specifically to filing amendments before a supplementary European search report is drawn up, which is relevant only when there is an intention for international preliminary examination.\n- In this case, since no such request was made, there would be no need or opportunity for the applicant to file further amendments in anticipation of a supplementary European search.\n\n**Why D is incorrect:**\n- Form 1226AC indicates that the examination has started. While it may be issued at some point during the regional phase, it does not serve the purpose of inviting comments and amendments from the applicant.\n- The communication to file observations and correct deficiencies precedes formal examination activities.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, the appropriate communication will be **Form 1226BB** as it directly addresses the need to invite comments and amendments from the applicant upon entry into the regional phase without an international preliminary examination request.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html"

In this scenario, if Company M chooses the EPO as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and files the PCT-M application in Spanish, which is a non-English language used as an official language by several contracting states, it can then designate the USPTO as the IPEA since English is one of the official languages of the United States.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the EPO does not need to be chosen as the ISA first. Option C is also incorrect as the Austrian Patent Office cannot be designated as an ISA for a PCT application filed in Spanish, which is not an official language used by Austria. Finally, option D is incorrect because the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore would not be appropriate given that English is already one of the official languages for the USPTO.\n\nThe correct choice (A) allows for both the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA, which aligns with the legal text provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B: Yes, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 7 November 2023. According to Rule 52(3) EPC as stated in the provided text, an applicant may add a missing declaration of priority within 'sixteen months from the earliest priority date claimed, or, where the correction would cause a change in the earliest priority date claimed, within sixteen months from the correct earliest priority date, whichever sixteen-month period expires first.' In this case, the correct earliest priority date is 3 July 2022. Therefore, the time limit for adding EP-II as a priority application would be until 7 November 2023 (16 months after 3 July 2022).\n\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A (November 3, 2023) is incorrect because it assumes that the priority claim should be added within 4 months from the filing date of PCT-P. However, Rule 52(3) EPC states a 16-month period.\n- Option C (October 20, 2023) is incorrect as it suggests an even shorter time frame for adding the priority claim which contradicts the 16-month limit given by Rule 52(3).\n- Option D (July 3, 2023) is incorrect because it indicates that the period has already expired. According to Rule 52(3), the applicant still has until November 7, 2023, to add this missing priority claim.\n\nTherefore, based on the legal texts provided and the specific rule governing the addition of declarations of priority in EPC, option B is correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html"

The opposition division's communication providing an opportunity to file comments within a four-month period after receipt by 1 June 2023 complies with the procedural requirements as long as the comments were submitted before or on the deadline of October 12, 2023.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nA. The opponent/ respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.\n- This is not necessary because the four-month period has been adhered to, and no extension was required or requested by the opponent/respondent.\n\nB. The opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing.\n- There is no indication in the provided case law that an additional fee would be required just for submitting comments within the given timeframe.\n\nC.

The third year's renewal fee would be due one day after the anniversary of the filing date, which is January 31, 2024 (one day after March 20, 2023). \\n\\nSince proceedings were interrupted and will now resume on October 12, 2023, this triggers the automatic resumption of any periods that had been suspended. Therefore, the third-year renewal fee can be paid with an additional fee by April 30, 2024 (see Rule 51(2) EPC and J 4/91, reasons 2.7). \\n\\n- Option A: Incorrect because the application is not automatically deemed withdrawn due to non-payment of renewal fees; it only becomes subject to this risk if the proceedings are deemed abandoned or otherwise suspended.\\n- Option B: Incorrect as the statement refers to 'without any additional fee,' which does not align with Rule 51(2) EPC, where an additional fee is required for payment after the due date.\\n- Option D: Incorrect because it suggests a later deadline than what is allowed according to Rule 51(2), and also incorrectly states that the third-year renewal fee can be paid on October 12, 2023, which is not accurate as per the rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html"

Since no priority is claimed and the application is published within 18 months from the filing date, it does not trigger any additional requirements for designation fees or renewal fees.\n\n- **Option B** (paying the renewal fee for the third year) is incorrect because there's no indication that the EP phase has started yet; thus, the renewal fee for the first year after the EP phase entry isn't due at this stage.\n  \n- **Option C** (appointing a representative) is unnecessary as per E-IX 2.8 unless explicitly required by national laws or specific circumstances not mentioned here.\n\n- **Option D** (none of the above statements) is incorrect because option A correctly identifies what actions are necessary based on the provided information and legal context.\n\nGiven that the application has been published at 18 months + 1 day, and a request for early processing has been filed, it falls under the category where only filing Form 1200, paying the filing fee, and the search fee need to be addressed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html"

Specifically, the text states that 'The designation fee(s) must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application.' However, since the initial application was not a divisional one and no further information about divisional applications is relevant to this scenario, we focus on the main application. The text does not indicate any conditions under which a validly paid designation fee can be refunded, except for scenarios where the application might be deemed withdrawn or refused.

In this scenario, since the applicant notices on 10 October 2024 that the third-year renewal fee is not yet due and should not be debited from their deposit account, they can revoke the debit order up until 17 October 2024 (the day before it would become due if requested separately). Option A is incorrect because a request for revocation must be made after the fee has been requested and before it becomes due. Option C is incorrect as per Rule 51(2), since by this date, if not revoked, the fee would become due. Option D is incorrect because according to the rules, a partial revocation of a combined request for fees is permissible until the day before the fee becomes due if requested separately.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_2.html"

Merely appealing does not address the underlying issue of re-establishing rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor.\n   - **Answer B (File a request for further processing):** The applicant can indeed file a request for further processing under Rule 71(3) EPC within two months of notification, as per Article 90(5) EPC. This is a separate mechanism from appealing and can be used to address the specific issue of rectifying the time limit for filing the designation.\n   - **Answer C (File a request for re-establishment of rights):** While this option correctly identifies that the applicant can file a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit, it is not comprehensive.

This aligns with the information presented in 'Legal Basis' stating that third-party observations are subject to certain formalities such as being filed in writing and in an official language.\n\n- **Why Answer A is Incorrect**: The legal text makes it clear that a person filing third-party observations is not a party to the proceedings, and the applicant has no obligation to respond. This contradicts Statement A, which incorrectly suggests both that the filer is a party and that the applicant must respond.\n  \n- **Why Answer B is Incorrect**: While the guidelines state that third-party observations must be filed in writing (as per 'Legal Basis'), they can indeed be filed anonymously as indicated by the EPO notice dated July 5, 2017. This directly contradicts Statement B, which incorrectly asserts that such observations cannot be anonymous.\n\n- **Why Answer C is Incorrect**: The guidelines do not require an official fee for filing third-party observations and state that supporting documents can be written in any language (as per 'Legal Basis' from A-VII, 3.5). Additionally, the case law does not mention a requirement to pay an official fee (Case Law III, N.2.4) or that observations must include a statement of grounds.

In this case, the communication was dated 25 September 2024, so the time limit for paying the additional search fees would be by 25 October 2024 (two months later). Option B is incorrect because Rule 68(1) EPC requires an applicant to notify the ISA whether they accept the invitation to pay these fees or request an extension for payment. Option C is incorrect because paying additional search fees under protest does not incur any extra protest fee according to Rule 40(2)(c) PCT.

The correct procedure involves requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LIPOffice) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nOption B: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau would enable it to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application. However, this option is not provided as a means for filing with the EPO directly; rather, it's about accessing documents through an authorized service. Since the document clearly states that the priority document can be filed in paper form or electronically using OLFEPO Online Filing or Online Filing 2.0, a DAS code does not fit within these guidelines.\n\nOption C: While filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO is possible according to the text, it would imply that a digital access service (DAS) is in place for both the Luxembourg and other participating offices, which is not specifically mentioned as a requirement. Therefore, this option is more about using a specific method but not necessarily the only or most direct way.\n\nOption D: Filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau is incorrect because the Guidelines clearly state that priority documents must be filed directly with the EPO and do not mention any role for the International Bureau in this context. The International Bureau's function is to communicate between the EPO and other international offices, but it does not handle direct filing of certified copies.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is A: Requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_3_3.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "This answer is correct because when the opposition division decides to revoke a patent at the end of the opposition proceedings, the opponent(s), in this case Firm B, can file an appeal against that decision. According to the provided legal text from T 693/98 (Case Law IV, C.5.2.1) and T 1341/04, it is explicitly stated that opponents are able to re-argue matters even if they did not appeal certain findings by the opposition division when a patent has been revoked.\n\nLet's examine why other options are incorrect:\n\nB is incorrect because there seems to be a typo in this option: 'At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to and firm B are entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision.' The phrase 'the opposition division decided to' is incomplete. Assuming it should read 'The opposition division decided to maintain,' then this statement would be incorrect because under normal circumstances, only the patentee (Firm A) has a right to appeal if the patent is maintained as granted.\n\nC is incorrect based on the legal context provided by T 693/98 and T 1341/04. In these cases, it's noted that opponents can file an appeal even when they did not raise certain issues during the opposition proceedings, particularly in situations where the patent has been revoked.\n\nD is incorrect because if Firm B withdrew its opposition before the decision was made, there would be no final decision to appeal. The question states 'At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided,' which implies that a final decision had already been reached by then.\n\nThus, based on the legal context provided in T 693/98 and T 1341/04, Firm B can indeed file an appeal against the opposition division's decision to revoke the patent.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_5_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.1.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_1_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_1.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is C because, as per Rule 51(4) and Rule 51(5), in cases where there is a successful request for re-establishment of rights under Article 122 or a successful petition for review of a decision of the board of appeal under Article 112a, the due date for renewal fees may be affected. In this scenario, EP -X-C0 received unitary effect on October 10, 2024. Therefore, according to Rule 71a(4), the renewal fee in respect of the next patent year (which is the 6th year) must now be paid directly to the Register of Community Designs and Patents.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Answer A**: Incorrect because a renewal fee does not need to be paid by October 31, 2024, in respect of the 5th year. The 5th year would have already expired before this date since it is customary that fees are due on or just after the anniversary of the filing date.\n\n- **Answer B**: Incorrect as per Rule 71a(4), once unitary effect has been registered for an EP-C0, any subsequent renewal fee must be paid directly to the Register and not to the EPO. Therefore, it would be incorrect to state that a renewal fee is due on October 31, 2024, in respect of the 5th year.\n\n- **Answer D**: Incorrect because under Rule 71a(4), a renewal fee is indeed required for EP -X-C0 after unitary effect has been granted. The failure to pay this fee could result in the application being deemed withdrawn (Article 86 and Article 141).\n\nTherefore, considering the context of receiving unitary effect on October 10, 2024, a renewal fee is due for the 6th year of EP -X-C0 by October 31, 2025.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Here, Korhonen has already provided an English (one of the official languages) translation when filing his European patent application. Thus, he can file amended claims in Finnish and provide a corresponding English translation within the time limit.\\n\\nOption A is incorrect because it states that Korhonen must first provide another translation into English, which would be redundant given that he has already provided an authorized translation with the original application. \\n\\nOption B is misleading as it suggests filing any official language of the EPO, but since he has already provided a translation in one such language (English), this option isn't necessary.\\n\\nOption D is incorrect because there are no restrictions on Korhonen filing amended claims in Finnish if they come with an authorized translation into an official language.

Option A incorrectly states that PCT Direct can be applied to a Belgian application filed in French, which does not qualify as PCT Direct can only be applied if the priority application is either an EP or a national application of an EPO Member State. Option C incorrectly states that an international application filed with the EPO in English qualifies for PCT Direct, when it must be based on a priority application from an EPO Member State. Option D incorrectly generalizes the requirement by suggesting that submitting amended claims in a single PDF document is a condition for all applications under PCT Direct, which only applies if amendments are necessary to overcome objections.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html"

The requirement is for an official language of the contracting states.\n  \n- Option C (Spanish) could seem plausible as Spanish is one of the 24 signatory states, but this is incorrect because under the UPCA framework, the requirement is specifically for translations in any of the 18 acceding states' official languages, not all signing states.\n\n- Option D (Spanish) can be ruled out based on similar reasoning; while it’s correct that Spanish might be an official language of one or more contracting states, the precise wording requires translation into a language officially recognized by at least one of the 18 acceding states.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_4_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_5.html"
