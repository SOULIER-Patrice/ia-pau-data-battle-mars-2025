Ms Smith can still be deleted as an inventor because no proceedings are pending does not mean she cannot be removed; the process just requires her consent.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The statement implies that the patent proprietor needs Mr Li's consent to request that Ms Smith be deleted, which is not required according to Rule 21(1) EPC. Only the wrongly designated person (Ms Smith in this case) needs to give their consent for the deletion.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

Additionally, it specifies filing \"in good time\" without providing a specific deadline for the authorization, making it less precise than option A.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the most accurate and complete answer to ensure that Y's appointment as representative and the timely response to the extended European search report do not result in any loss of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 151, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r151.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_2_2.html"

This includes missed deadlines related to filing within the priority period.\n\n- Option A (\"T ime limit for pay ing the designation fee\") is incorrect because designation fees are typically paid after the application has been accepted and are not subject to re-establishment of rights if they are missed.\n\n- Option B (\"T ime limit for requesting examination\") is incorrect as the guidelines do not mention that requests for examination can be remedied through re-establishment of rights. The time limits for requesting examination must be strictly observed, and failure to do so results in a non-compliant application.\n\n- Option D (\"T ime limit for paying the fee for re- establishment of rights\") is incorrect because such a fee does not exist according to the guidelines provided. Re-establishment of rights involves filing an application under Article 122, and there are no specific fees associated with this process that need to be paid after missing the original deadline.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C as it pertains to missed priority periods which can potentially be remedied through re-establishment of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

The Dutch national's status as resident would apply only if they were from a member state.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** A natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality filing a European patent application in French does not meet the criteria for a fee reduction under Rule 6(2)(a) EPC because neither the applicant's residence nor their nationality (Belgian, but not from a member state) qualifies them for this benefit.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** A natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality filing a European patent application in Italian does not meet the criteria either.

According to Rule 51(1) of the EPC, the renewal fee for the coming year is due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing of the European patent application. Since your application was filed on 16 November 2020, the fourth-year renewal fee falls due in November 2024, but as per the communication today, it will be due in November 2023. The EPO's time limit is stated to be within two months of the publication date (8 January 2014), so the due date aligns with 30 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Although you are validating only two states, the renewal fee must still be paid centrally to the EPO as per Rule 51(1) and not in each state separately.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. You have filed a European patent application that did not claim priority, so the fees should be paid centrally to the EPO.

Furthermore, the EPO does not require the payment of a fee for publishing a new specification; such fees are typically associated with national patent offices and do not pertain to the EPO's procedures.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Option B is inaccurate because it suggests that if an appeal is filed, the obligation to file translations of claims or a typed version would be waived. However, even in appeal proceedings, such requirements are still applicable post decision, assuming no specific exemption has been granted by the opposition division.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Option C incorrectly states that an invitation will automatically come with an interlocutory decision.

There's no reason to assume that it should be chosen as either ISA or IPEA for this particular filing scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct. According to EPC Article 88(1), an applicant must file a declaration of priority and any other required document within the time limit starting from the filing date of the previous application or, if it covers several applications, from the earliest of those dates. For EP-I filed on 7 July 2022, the time to add a missing priority claim expires 12 months after its filing date, which is by 7 July 2023. However, for EP-II filed on 3 July 2022, the time limit would be until 3 July 2023. Since applicant P discovered this issue on 12 October 2023, it falls within the extended deadline for EP-II's priority claim from 3 July 2023 to 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The time limit for adding the missing priority claim from EP-II would expire on 3 July 2023, not 7 November 2023.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. October 2023 already passed the deadline for both EP-I and EP-II's priority claims.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. While the time limit did expire by 3 July 2023 for adding a missing claim to EP-II, it does not affect the ability to add the validly discovered missing claim from EP-II up until 3 November 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

In this case, the opponent/respondent has filed comments after the four-month period (which expired on 30 September 2023). As per the rule, they need to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no indication in the EPC rules that a fee is required simply because the opponent/respondent filed comments out of time. The requirement to pay a fee would typically be associated with specific procedural actions such as requesting reestablishment of rights, which is not the scenario here.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The opponent/respondent does not need to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee. They have merely filed comments late; no right has been lost that would necessitate such an action.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since option A correctly identifies the necessary action, option D cannot be correct as it states \"None of the above.\"\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to Rule 51(2) EPC and considering that proceedings were interrupted under Rule 142 EPC, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on or before the last day of the respective year. The third patent year starts on 20 March 2021 and ends on 19 March 2022, so the third-year renewal fee should have been paid by 31 March 2022. Similarly, the fourth patent year starts on 20 March 2022 and ends on 19 March 2023, so the fourth-year renewal fee is due no later than 31 March 2023. Given that today is 12 October 2023, this means the fees for these years can still be validly paid without an additional fee up to and including 12 October 2023, which falls within the period from 1 April 2024 back to 12 October 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The application has not been deemed withdrawn due to non-payment of renewal fees; it remains active since proceedings are set to resume.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The additional fee for payment after the last day for valid payment (i.e., 19 March) cannot be paid by 30 April 2024 at the latest, as this is outside the grace period for payment without an additional fee.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to C, paying renewal fees with or without an additional fee after 31 October 2023 (which is beyond both the third and fourth years) would be considered late.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Since the question states that you must pay by \"by 25 October 2024,\" this is a correct statement assuming an immediate payment.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The EPO's communication includes a provisional opinion and invites you to comment on it, so not filing a response would be neglecting your procedural rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** If you pay the additional search fees under protest, according to EPC Rule 64(2), you are required to file two protest fees within the same time limit for each invention for which the fee was paid under protest. Therefore, paying protest fees without paying the initial search fees would be incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, it does not automatically mean that the international patent application will be deemed withdrawn.

Thus, Firm C has no standing to file an appeal against the decision.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it is true that Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings, this does not entitle them to file an appeal when the division maintains the patent. Withdrawal of an opposition generally means that the opposition is terminated and cannot be re-filed, but it does not grant automatic appellate rights if the division upholds the patent.\n\nTherefore, only option A correctly identifies a party (Firm B) who can appeal a decision to revoke the patent.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

This service provides an alternative method for submitting documents during such unforeseen circumstances.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While the EPO Contingency Upload Service can be useful in certain situations, it is not recommended specifically when the EPO's filing systems are functioning correctly but you encounter a technical issue at your end. In that case, other means like MyEPO Portfolio or Online Filing 2.0 might be more appropriate.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The service is not intended for use solely because documents are submitted after business hours; it is specifically designed for situations where the EPO's systems are unavailable due to a system outage.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** If the EPO is closed on an official holiday, it implies that no services are being provided by the EPO, making the use of any filing service unnecessary. The Contingency Upload Service would only be applicable during operational times when there's a specific technical issue with the EPO systems.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

Here, providing a translation into English, which is one of the official languages of the EPO, satisfies this requirement.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: While filing the amended claims in Finnish is allowed, the requirement for a timely translation into an official language must still be met, making option A overly restrictive.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Although it is true that providing a translation into any official language of the EPO would suffice, the guidelines specify that English should be used as one of the official languages, not just \"any.\" Therefore, this option lacks specificity regarding the correct official language (English in this context).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: This option incorrectly states that Korhonen is not allowed to file amended claims in Finnish at all, which contradicts the guidelines allowing native language submissions followed by a translation.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

The key here is that both applications are in an official language of the EPO, which allows for direct filing under PCT Direct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**:\n  If the priority application is an EP application (which is an EP application and hence in an official language) filed in French and the international application is also filed in English with Online Filing 2.0, this scenario does not align as both applications must be in the same official EPO language for PCT Direct to be applicable.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**:\n  Although the priority application (an international application) was initially filed with the EPO in English and subsequently searched by the EPO, if the subsequent international application is filed in a different language (English as per the question), it does not meet the requirement for PCT Direct to be applicable.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**:\n  While filing amended claims with a PCT Direct letter is common practice, it is not a mandatory condition for the availability of PCT Direct. The primary conditions are that both applications must be in an official EPO language and filed via the appropriate means (ePCT-Filing or Online Filing 2.0).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

Mr Linguist must provide a translation into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA), as stated in Article 6(1) Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012, which specifies that the translation may be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The requirement for a translation into an official language does not depend on the states to which the unitary effect extends but specifically refers to the 24 states that have signed the UPCA.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Spanish is not one of the official languages of the European Union, and therefore, it would not satisfy the requirement for a translation into an EU official language.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Although Dutch is the original filing language, the provision requires a translation in an official language of any member state that has signed the UPCA, which may include other languages such as German or French, but not necessarily Dutch again.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
