The deadline for filing a response to the extended European search report is 12 October 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Option B does not mention filing an authorization from the applicant, which is necessary to validate Y’s appointment and any subsequent actions taken on behalf of the application. Without this authorization, all communications by Y would be invalid.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect.

This includes the time limit for filing the application within the priority period.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The time limit for requesting examination (Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1)) involves both filing a written request and paying an examination fee, which can be remedied through the process of further processing (E-VIII, 2). Re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 is not applicable to these procedural acts.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The time limit for paying the designation fee is a specific administrative requirement that falls outside the scope of re-establishment of rights under Article 122. Designation fees must be paid within the specified period, and missing this deadline typically means the application will not proceed in certain designated states.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights (Rule 136) itself cannot be extended or remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights.

Since Belgium is a contracting state to the EPC and the applicant in option C is a natural person of Belgian nationality residing in the USA, they qualify for the reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The applicant in this case (a Spanish European patent attorney filing on behalf of a resident and national from Andorra) would not be eligible for a reduced fee because Andorra is not a contracting state to the EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Although both applicants reside in Germany, the natural person has Dutch nationality, and there's no information suggesting that the firm qualifies as a small or medium-sized enterprise (SME). Additionally, only individuals with their principal place of residence in an EPC contracting state can benefit from reduced fees.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The applicant in this case is a resident of the USA and of Swiss nationality. Although Switzerland is a contracting state to the EPC, the fact that the applicant resides outside any contracting state disqualifies them for the reduction under Rule 6 EPC (since residence within an EPC contracting state or being a national thereof is required).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 58, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a58.html\nSource: EPC Article 75, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a75.html\nSource: EPC Rule 152, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r152.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_4.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct. According to Rule 36(2) EPC and Article 14(2) EPC, if a divisional application filed in a non-official language (in this case Dutch) is not accompanied by a translation into an official EPO language (English, French or German), the application will be deemed withdrawn under Article 14(2) EPC. Since Mr Van Holland has not filed an English translation of EP-div and the Receiving Section has issued a noting of loss of rights, this deficiency cannot be remedied after the issuance of such a notice as it means the divisional application is now deemed withdrawn.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The time to file a translation into an official EPO language was within two months from the filing date of EP-div according to Rule 36(2) EPC. Once the Receiving Section has issued a noting of loss of rights, it means that Mr Van Holland missed this deadline and cannot now remedy the deficiency merely by filing a translation.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Requesting further processing under Rule 137 EPC would be relevant if there were a defect in the application’s examination procedure or formality deficiencies that could be rectified, but it does not apply here because the lack of an official language translation within the prescribed time means that EP-div has already been deemed withdrawn.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Re-establishment of rights under Rule 134 EPC is applicable only if there was an unintentional lapse due to a procedural error and if it can be demonstrated that all necessary requirements were fulfilled except for some formal deficiency within the time limit. However, in this case, since Mr Van Holland did not comply with the language requirement at all, re-establishment of rights cannot apply here either.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

When an application progresses to grant, any renewal fees due after this point must be paid separately to each national office where validation is sought. The communication from the EPO indicates that the mention of grant will occur shortly (on 16 November 2023), and thus the fourth-year renewal fee must be paid to the relevant national offices rather than centrally through the EPO. According to Article 86, paragraph 1, there is a two-month grace period after publication in which additional fees can be paid without penalty. Therefore, if the grant mention publishes on 16 November 2023, you have until 9 January 2024 (two months from this date) to pay the renewal fee for the fourth year.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The renewal fee for the fourth year cannot be paid centrally after the patent has been granted; it must be handled separately in each state where validation occurs. Additionally, the due date would be 16 November 2023 only if you were still paying through the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The renewal fee for the fourth year cannot be paid centrally after the patent has been granted; it must be handled separately in each state where validation occurs. Additionally, the due date should reflect the specific validation states’ requirements rather than a generic European Patent Office (EPO) due date.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

During oral proceedings, if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent in an amended form that includes a paragraph with handwritten amendments, it would be necessary for the patent proprietor to pay the fee for publishing a new specification and file translations of the claims. Additionally, they must provide a formally compliant version of the entire description including the typed version of the amended paragraph.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Even if an appeal is filed, it does not exempt the patent proprietor from providing the necessary documents as required by the opposition division’s decision. The process for publishing and translating must still be completed after any appeals are resolved or while they are pending.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. An invitation to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims, and provide a formally compliant version of the amended paragraph typically comes upon request from the patent office rather than automatically with the interlocutory decision.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

The Austrian Patent Office can act as the ISA, but the EPO acting simultaneously as the IPEA would not comply with the rules that dictate the choice of one office as an ISA and another as an IPEA if required by the applicant's choice.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. This option incorrectly pairs the EPO as ISA and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) as IPEA, which does not conform to the available options for ISA and IPEA roles provided in the context. The USPTO or another listed office would be a more appropriate choice than IPOS if an applicant chooses the EPO as ISA.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- According to Rule 17.1 PCT and Rule 17.2 PCT, under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), a priority claim can be added within 14 months from the earliest priority date claimed in the international application. Since the applicant filed EP-I on 7 July 2022 as the earliest priority document, the deadline for adding another priority claim is 14 months from this date, which falls on 7 November 2023.\n- However, Rule 19.1 PCT allows for an extension to add a missing priority reference within 30 months from the earliest claimed filing date (i.e., 7 July 2022), and in the context of these rules and the given situation, it would be interpreted that the 14-month deadline should still apply here.\n- Option B is incorrect because it suggests the limit expires on 7 November 2023 but the new priority claim (EP-II) can actually be added up to 3 November 2023 since EP-II’s date is earlier than EP-I's date by a few days and 14 months from this date would be 3 November 2023.\n- Option C is incorrect because it suggests the time limit expires on 20 October 2023, which falls well within the correct period but does not align with the proper calculation based on PCT rules.\n- Option D is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the time limit for adding a priority claim expired on 3 July 2023. The actual deadline for claiming an additional priority document under the PCT rules extends up to 14 months from the earliest claimed date (i.e., until 7 November 2023).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct. According to Rule 100(2) EPC, if a party fails to reply in due time to an invitation to file observations, it can request reestablishment of rights under Article 122 and Rule 134 EPC by filing a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and paying the associated fee. The opponent/respondent failed to submit comments within the prescribed four-month period and submitted their comments only on October 12, 2023, which is after the deadline. Therefore, they need to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Requesting an extension of the period for comment is not applicable here because Rule 100(2) EPC does not provide for extensions; rather, it specifies that if there is no timely reply, provisions regarding reestablishment of rights apply.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. There is no specific fee mentioned in Rule 100 or related case law that the opponent/respondent needs to pay simply because they missed the deadline for filing comments. The only fee relevant here would be the one associated with a request for reestablishment of rights under Article 122 and Rule 134 EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. None of the above does not apply since option C provides a valid course of action (filing a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and paying the associated fee) as per the relevant procedural rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

                    "Justification": "- According to Rule 134 EPC and Article 86(2) of the EPC, proceedings under interruption do not count towards the time limits for payment of renewal fees. Therefore, the applicant is entitled to a six-month grace period from the date of resumption of proceedings to pay any outstanding renewal fees with an additional fee.\n- The application was filed on March 20, 2020. Since there have been no renewals paid so far as of October 12, 2023, and given that proceedings were interrupted from March 10, 2022 until resumption today (October 12, 2023), the applicant must pay the renewal fees for years three (March 20, 2022 - March 20, 2023) and four (March 20, 2023 - March 20, 2024). The six-month grace period means the latest date to pay these renewal fees with an additional fee is April 30, 2024.\n- Option A is incorrect because despite no payment so far, Rule 134 provides a mechanism to reinstate the application within the six-month grace period.\n- Option B is incorrect as it suggests the applicant can pay without any additional fee by October 12, 2023. This overlooks the fact that the renewal fees for years three and four have already passed their due dates, meaning an additional fee must be paid.\n- Option D is incorrect because while it mentions payment with an additional fee within a shorter timeframe (by October 31, 2023), this does not align with Rule 134's six-month grace period which extends until April 30, 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

According to Rule 159(1), within thirty-one months from the filing date, an applicant must perform specific acts for entry into the European phase. For a CN applicant at 25 months after filing (with no priority claimed), they need to complete and file Form 1200 and pay both the filing fee and the search fee since the supplementary European search report has to be drawn up.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The renewal fee for the third year, as per Rule 159(1)(g), is due if it falls earlier under Rule 51(1). However, given that we are only at 25 months and not past the end of the third year (36 months from filing), there would be no obligation to pay this fee yet.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The requirement for appointing a representative is not listed among the requirements under Rule 159(1) for entering into the EP phase. It is optional and does not need to be fulfilled by the specified deadline unless explicitly required by other circumstances not mentioned here.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Since statement A accurately reflects all necessary actions needed at this stage, stating \"none of the above\" would be incorrect as there is a correct option provided (A).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

According to Rule 39 EPC, after 1 April 2009, a single designation fee must be paid within six months from the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. Therefore, if the applicant withdraws the application during this period and before paying the designation fee, they may obtain a refund of the designation fee.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The deadline for withdrawal to get a refund of the designation fee is six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report (not on the date itself), as per Rule 39 EPC.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The designation fee can still be refunded if withdrawn within the prescribed period under certain conditions; it is not automatically non-refundable once paid.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The start of substantive examination does not relate to the time limit for withdrawing the application in order to obtain a refund of the designation fee, which is tied specifically to the publication date of the European search report and the six-month grace period thereafter.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

According to OJ EPO 2024, Supplementary Publication 2, Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA), 13.2 states that a debit order with a deferred payment date may be revoked in whole or in part until one day before the execution date at the latest. Since the specified execution date of the debit order is 18 October 2024, it can be revoked until 17 October 2024.\n  \n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The applicant has until one day before the execution date (17 October 2024) to revoke the order in part; therefore, revoking on the same day the request was filed (10 October 2024) is not the latest possible time.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The debit order cannot be revoked once it has been executed (on 18 October 2024). Hence, revocation on that specific date would not be effective.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. A debit order can indeed be revoked in part according to ADA rules, making the statement inaccurate and leading to this option being incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html"

This appeals process allows for a review of the refusal and is a valid remedy in this situation.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. There is no provision under Article 94(3) EPC or Rule 60 EPC that allows for further processing after the deadline has passed once a decision to refuse an application based on non-compliance with procedural requirements has been issued.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The applicant cannot file a request for re-establishment of rights (Article 122 EPC) in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor after the Receiving Section has already refused the European patent application based on the missed deadline. Article 122(4) excludes the possibility of re-establishing rights regarding the time limits set by the Office.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

This aligns with the statement provided in option D.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it's true that third-party observations must be filed in writing (per Rule 114(1) of the EPC), these observations can, in fact, be filed anonymously. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO clarify that anonymity is allowed and does not disqualify submissions.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: According to Article 115 and Rule 114(2) of the EPC, third-party observations do not require an official fee; they can be submitted freely. Additionally, while a statement of grounds is helpful, it is not strictly required for consideration by the examining division. The examining or opposition division will take these into account regardless, as long as they are relevant.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: Contrary to option A's assertion, third-party observers who submit observations do not become parties to the proceedings before the EPO. Furthermore, while applicants can choose to respond to these observations, there is no obligation for them to do so under the EPC. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO clarify that the applicant or patent proprietor may comment on such observations but are not required to do so.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 64(1) and Rule 172.1 PCT, when the EPO acting as ISA identifies that an international application lacks unity of invention, it will draw up a partial search report and invite the applicant to pay additional search fees for each additional invention (up to two in this case). The time limit given is generally one month from the date of the communication. Since you received the communication on 25 September 2024, the deadline to pay the two additional search fees would be 25 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Although you do not necessarily need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results, it is advisable as it provides an opportunity for further clarification or discussion on the unity issue. Not responding might lead to potential procedural issues later on.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: If you pay additional search fees under protest, typically only one protest fee applies per international application (Rule 89.1 PCT). Therefore, paying two separate protest fees is not required according to the rules.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: According to Rule 48bis PCT, failure to pay additional search fees does not result in withdrawal of the international patent application but rather limits the scope of examination only to those inventions covered by the paid fees. The application remains pending and can still be processed for further procedures such as entering national phase unless other procedural deficiencies arise.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

This aligns with modern practices for digital exchange and verification.\n\n- Explanation of why A, C, and D are incorrect.\n  - **A** is incorrect because it suggests that the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office should directly send a certified copy to the EPO, but this does not conform to standard procedures involving the International Bureau (IB) or the use of Digital Access Service codes.\n  \n  - **C** is incorrect since filing an electronic certified copy directly with the EPO would not be in compliance with the protocol for international applications where certification and validation processes are typically handled through official channels like DAS or by the receiving Office/International Bureau.\n\n  - **D** is also incorrect because while a certified copy could theoretically be filed with the International Bureau, it is more efficient and procedurally correct to use the Digital Access Service (DAS), which simplifies and automates this process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

If at the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decides to revoke the patent, only the patent proprietor (Firm A) can file an appeal against this decision according to the EPC. However, since Firm B requested revocation and their request was met by the division's decision, they cannot be entitled to appeal a favorable outcome.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The statement in option B is incomplete and unclear but implies that Firm A (the patent proprietor) would not have grounds to file an appeal if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted, which contradicts the EPC. In reality, the patent proprietor has the right to appeal a decision that affects their rights.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. According to the EPC and case law, only the patent proprietor (Firm A) or those who filed oppositions against the patent (such as Firm B) can file an appeal against the opposition division's decision. Observers like Firm C cannot file appeals because they are not parties to the proceedings.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Once Firm B withdraws its opposition, it is no longer a party to the opposition proceedings and thus loses standing to file an appeal against any further decisions made by the opposition division regarding maintenance or revocation of the patent.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

Since European patent EP-X was granted and published on 2 October 2024, it means that renewal fees for subsequent years still need to be paid for the regular European patent (EP-X) until unitary effect is registered. The filing date is 1 October 2020, so the fifth year’s renewal fee would fall due on 31 October 2024.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Unitary effect (EP -X-C0) registration does not create a new set of renewal fees that are due from the moment it takes effect; instead, the original patent's existing renewal obligations continue until they are fulfilled or transferred to the unitary patent system.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The sixth year’s renewal fee would be due in 2025, not in 2024.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. A renewal fee still needs to be paid by 31 October 2024 for EP-X since the unitary effect was registered later on 10 October 2024, and it does not retroactively affect prior renewal obligations up until that date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct. According to Rule 126(2) EPC, where notification is effected by registered letter, the document shall be deemed to have been delivered on the tenth day following its posting unless it can be proven that the receipt was later than this ten-day period. The communication is dated 12 September 2024 and received by the applicant on 21 September 2024, which is nine days after the date it bears. Since the document was delivered within seven days plus two additional days, the deadline for reply shall be extended by these two days.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Option B (12 January 2025) assumes that there is no extension due to late receipt, which contradicts Rule 126(2) EPC as the document was received nine days after its date, indicating a delay beyond seven days.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Option C (22 January 2025) suggests an unreasonable extension that does not align with Rule 126(2) EPC's criteria for adjusting deadlines based on late receipt.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Option D (14 January 2025) incorrectly assumes a one-day adjustment rather than the correct two days required to account for the delay in notification.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

The EPO Contingency Upload Service is recommended for use when there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via standard filing systems, ensuring documents can still be submitted during such disruptions.\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Submitting documents after business hours does not necessitate the use of the EPO Contingency Upload Service; normal electronic filing methods are generally available outside of regular office hours.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. If there is a technical issue at your end, the problem may be resolved through troubleshooting or using alternative standard filing systems rather than relying on the contingency service.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday, no filings are required as per normal business procedures, and therefore the use of the Contingency Upload Service would not apply.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

Since the original patent application was already filed with an English translation in time, he can also file the amended claims in Finnish followed by an English translation within the specified timeframe.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While Korhonen can indeed file the amended claims in Finnish initially, the translation must be into English specifically and not any official language arbitrarily chosen. Therefore, this statement lacks specificity regarding the required language for the translation.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Although this option correctly states that a translation into English is needed, it does not clearly specify that the initial filing can be in Finnish first, which is allowed under EPO guidelines.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Korhonen is explicitly permitted to file the amended claims initially in his native language (Finnish), as long as he follows up with an accurate translation into English within the stipulated period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why D is correct. PCT Direct allows applicants to submit informal comments via a PCT Direct letter aimed at overcoming objections raised in the search opinion, but it does not require or specify that amended claims must be filed with this letter in a single PDF document. The requirement for specific formatting such as including amended claims and informal comments in one PDF is not mandated by PCT Direct.\n\n- Explanation of why B, C, and A are incorrect.\n    - Option A: PCT Direct can indeed be used if the priority application is a Belgian application filed in French that has been searched and the international application is filed in French using ePCT -Filing. This scenario aligns with the conditions for PCT Direct.\n    - Option B: PCT Direct is also available if the priority application is an EP application in French, which was already searched, and the international application is filed in English via Online Filing 2.0. The requirement that the EPO has conducted a search on the priority application meets the criteria for PCT Direct.\n    - Option C: This scenario where the priority application is an international application (PCT) filed with the EPO in English and subsequently another international application is filed in English using Online Filing 2.0 also fits within the scope of PCT Direct. The essential condition that the priority application was searched by the EPO remains satisfied.\n\nThus, only statement D introduces a requirement not specified under PCT Direct rules, making it incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

According to Article 6(1) Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 and Rule 6(2)(d), a translation may be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU, except English, irrespective of the language in which the application was filed or the geographical extent of the unitary effect. Therefore, providing a translation into Spanish is valid.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The statement mentions that Mr Linguist must provide a translation into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends; however, the regulation does not limit translations to only those languages spoken in the 18 member states but instead refers to all 24 official EU languages.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The statement mentions that Mr Linguist must provide a translation into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA, which is misleading because it does not specify these are official EU languages. Furthermore, Spanish would be valid as per the regulation, and the limitation to only the signatory states' official languages is unnecessary.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The statement mentions that Mr Linguist must provide a translation into Dutch, but since the application was already filed in Dutch and English is used as the language of proceedings, it would not be necessary to translate back into Dutch for unitary effect registration purposes. Additionally, Spanish (as per option D) meets the regulation's requirements.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
