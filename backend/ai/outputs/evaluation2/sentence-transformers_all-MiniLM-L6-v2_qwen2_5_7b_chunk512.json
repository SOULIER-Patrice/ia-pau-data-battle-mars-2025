However, such a request requires Mr Li's consent because he has been rightfully identified as the sole inventor.\\n\\nWhy Other Options Are Incorrect:\\n- **Option A:** This statement suggests that the patent proprietor alone can request the deletion of Ms Smith without any other party’s consent. However, according to Rule 21(1) EPC, such a change requires both the consent of the wrongly designated person (Ms Smith) and the patent proprietor.\\n\\n- **Option B:** This is incorrect because it suggests that no one has the authority or ability to delete Ms Smith as an inventor due to the absence of pending proceedings. In fact, the patent proprietor can still request a rectification in this case.\\n\\n- **Option D:** This option incorrectly states that only Ms Smith's consent is required for her deletion from the list of inventors.

In this case, since attorney X was handling EP -A until 6 October 2023 and then attorney Y was appointed to replace him on that same date, the new time limit for filing the response would be up to 12 January 2024.\n\nHowever, according to Rule 142(3) of the Guidelines (which aligns with Article 133(2)(a)), if no representative is appointed within three months after the beginning of the interruption, the EPO will communicate that the proceedings will be resumed with the applicant or proprietor. Given that attorney Y was appointed on October 6th and there's a three-month period for action (up to January 12th), it would not have been necessary to file an authorisation signed by the applicant immediately as of October 6.\n\nAttorney Y should:\n- Request a change of representative;\n- File a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 January 2024 at the latest (three months from October 6).\n\nOption A is correct because it includes all these necessary steps while being within the given period. \n\nOption B: This option omits the requirement for an authorisation signed by the applicant, which is crucial to formally appoint a new representative.\n\nOption C: This option incorrectly extends the deadline for filing both the response and the change of representative request until 23 October 2023, which would not be correct as per Rule 142(3) given that it exceeds three months from when attorney Y was appointed.\n\nOption D: While this choice includes an authorisation signed by the applicant, like option A, it incorrectly extends the deadline for both actions to 23 October 2023.

According to Rule 51(1), the payment should be due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the filing date, which in this case would be 30 November 2023.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that the renewal fee must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated. However, Rule 51(4) states that if a European patent application has been granted by the EPO and rights are re-established under Article 122, any renewal fees due should still be paid centrally to the EPO.\n\nOption D is incorrect for the same reasons as Option C.

Also, if amendments are made during oral proceedings and include handwritten changes, it is generally expected that the patent proprietor will file a formally compliant version of the amended document within a reasonable timeframe, such as four months from receiving the interlocutory decision (as implied in option D). Option A is incorrect because there is no requirement to specifically pay fees for publishing translations or filing new versions of the claims just due to amendments during oral proceedings. The fee mentioned would likely pertain only to the publication of a new specification, not translations or claim filings. Option B is incorrect as it contradicts the procedural economy principle highlighted in H-III, 2.4 and D-V, 5 where filing a completely retyped description should be avoided, even during appeal proceedings when no changes are necessary due to the pending litigation status. Option C is incorrect because while an invitation might be sent to pay for publication of a new specification and file compliant versions of amended documents, it does not align with the principle of procedural economy as described in the guidelines.

In this case, the applicant filed the international patent application PCT-P on 20 June 2023, claiming priority from European patent application EP-I with a filing date of 7 July 2022. The additional claim to the second European patent application (EP-II) should be made within 16 months after its own filing date.\\n\\nGiven that EP-II was filed on 3 July 2022, the time limit for claiming priority from this application would expire 16 months later, which is by 3 January 2024. Since today is 12 October 2023, there are still some days remaining within this timeframe.\\n\\nThe exact date of when the claim can be added is before the end of this 16-month period on or after 3 July 2024 - specifically until just before 3 January 2024. To find out the precise date, one needs to consider that Rule 17.2 PCT allows claims at any time before or with the international application.\\n\\nFor clarity:\\n- Option A is incorrect because it suggests a date beyond when the claim can be added.\\n- Option C is incorrect as it offers an expired deadline already in October 2023, which does not allow for adding the priority claim within the remaining time limit.\\n- Option D is incorrect since it states that the time limit has already passed by 3 July 2023, whereas Rule 17.2 PCT allows the addition of a priority claim until just before 3 January 2024.\\n\\nThus, answer B correctly identifies that the missing priority claim can still be validly added within the remaining period as long as it is submitted by or before 3 January 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "Explanation: According to Rule 51(2) and Rule 134 of the EPC, as well as Example 1 provided in the guidelines, renewal fees for European patent applications can be paid with an additional fee within a certain period if they are not paid by the due date. The relevant information from the question states that the application was filed on March 20, 2020, and is currently resuming proceedings after being interrupted on March 10, 2022. This means we need to calculate when renewal fees for the third and fourth years are due.\n\n- **Third Year**: The first day for validly paying the third-year renewal fee was April 30, 2022 (31 days after the filing date of March 31, 2021), with the due date being January 31, 2023.\n- **Fourth Year**: The first day for validly paying the fourth-year renewal fee is May 31, 2023, and the due date is January 31, 2024.\n\nSince proceedings have been resumed today (October 12, 2023), the applicant now has until April 30, 2024 (the end of the fourth year) to pay these renewal fees with an additional fee according to Rule 51(2).\n\n**Why B is correct:**\n- Option B states that renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on October 12, 2023, at the latest. This is incorrect because no payment has been made so far, meaning there is no grace period to pay the renewal fee without an additional fee.\n\n**Why C is correct:**\n- Option C states that renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by April 30, 2024. This aligns with Rule 51(2) but is not the latest date based on the provided information as October 12, 2023, is earlier.\n\n**Why D is correct:**\n- Option D states that renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by October 31, 2023. This is incorrect because no payment has been made so far, meaning there is no grace period to pay the renewal fee without an additional fee.\n\n**Why A is correct:**\n- Option A states that as no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn. However, this is incorrect because the application is not automatically withdrawn due to non-payment of renewal fees; it merely becomes inactive or lapses if the renewal fees are still unpaid and no additional fee has been paid within the grace period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Since no priority has been claimed and the filing date is within 25 months (which is well within the 31-month period), the requirements that must be met include:\\n\\n- Completing and filing Form 1200, which initiates the entry into the European phase.\\n- Paying the filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c) to start the examination process.\\n- Paying the search fee as specified in Rule 159(1)(e), since a search report has already been drawn up by CNIPA and published.\\n\\nOption A is correct because it covers all these necessary actions. The application does not meet any conditions that would require paying additional fees, such as the designation fee (Rule 159(1)(d)) or the renewal fee for the third year (Rule 159(1)(g)), since no earlier deadlines have been reached.\\n\\nExplanation of why other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option B**: This option includes an unnecessary payment: the renewal fee for the third year. The application is less than a year old, so this fee has not yet fallen due.\\n- **Option C**: While appointing a representative (as per Rule 159(1)(h)) might be advisable in practice, it is not required by the rule and thus would make option C incomplete compared to Option A.\\n- **Option D** claims none of the provided statements are correct. However, since Option A accurately reflects all necessary actions as stated above, this cannot be true.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

According to EPC Rule 39, paragraphs 2 and 3 (as referenced in the provided text), the designation fee shall be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. If the application is withdrawn after this period but before substantive examination begins, a refund at a rate of 50% may be available.\n\nAnswer A is correct because under EPC Rule 11 (RFees) as in force from November 1, 2016, if an application is withdrawn and has not yet started substantive examination, the applicant can obtain a 50% refund of the designation fee. This period runs for six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\nWhy B, C, D are incorrect:\n- **Answer B**: The option 'Date of mention of the publication of the European search report' is not correct because the regulation specifically states that a refund can be obtained within 6 months from this date. It does not specify that the application must be withdrawn on this exact date to qualify for a refund.\n  \n- **Answer C**: This statement is incorrect as it suggests that once the designation fee has been validly paid, there's no possibility of obtaining any refund. However, according to EPC Rule 11 (RFees), if an applicant decides to withdraw the application after the publication of the search report but before substantive examination begins, a partial or full refund can still be obtained.\n  \n- **Answer D**: 'Date of the start of substantive examination' is incorrect because the provision for a possible refund does not depend on the starting date of substantive examination. The rule specifically mentions the period within six months after the mention of the publication of the European search report, which is before any substantive examination would typically begin.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

According to the provided legal text in *Case Law III, U.2.2.7*, 'not debiting the fee automatically (in this case, the fee under R.82(2) EPC and the surcharge under R.82(3) EPC) constituted a substantial procedural violation on the part of the EPO.' This implies that once the decisive payment date has been reached, revoking an automatic debit order becomes too late to affect the payment.\n\nIn this scenario, the specified execution date for the renewal fee is 18 October 2024. The latest point in time for revoking a partial portion of the order (specifically the renewal fee) would be before that date, as indicated by option B (17 October 2024). By this deadline, any changes to the automatic debit order can still be made before it is executed.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A. 10 October 2024**: This is incorrect because on this date, the renewal fee should not yet be due and therefore revoking it at this point would not address the issue of debiting for a future date (18 October 2024).\n\n- **Option C. 18 October 2024**: This option is also incorrect as per *Case Law III, U.2.2.7*, which indicates that if an automatic debit order is revoked after the decisive payment date, it is too late to affect the payment.\n\n- **Option D. A debit order cannot be revoked in part**: While this statement might seem plausible at first glance, it does not accurately reflect the legal context provided. The text allows for revocation of a partial portion of an automatic debit order before its execution, but such changes must occur before the decisive payment date to avoid procedural violations.\n\nThus, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee is **17 October 2024** (option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html"

The time limit for filing a notice of appeal is four months from notification (Article 101(2) EPC), which aligns with this option.\\n\\n- **Option B**: There is no specific provision in Article 122 or Rule 60 that outlines 'request for further processing' as a remedy. The primary options are appealing the decision, requesting re-establishment of rights, or both.\\n\\n- **Option C**: According to Article 122(3) EPC, if an applicant can demonstrate that due care was taken and still missed the deadline, they may be eligible to have their rights re-established. However, this option does not account for filing a notice of appeal which is also necessary as per Article 101 EPC.\\n\\n- **Option D**: Given that Option B (request for further processing) is not supported by the legal text provided, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D as it encompasses the necessary steps of appealing the decision (Option A) and requesting re-establishment of rights (Option C).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_9.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: EPC Article 122, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a122.html"

The provided legal texts clearly state that 'Observations may be filed anonymously' (Option B is incorrect), and they must be submitted in writing and in an official language of the EPO. Article 115 EPC explicitly states, 'Art. 115 Rule 114(1) Documentary evidence and, in particular, publications submitted in support of the arguments may be filed in any language,' which means that while observations can be submitted in a non-official language, they must still comply with being filed in writing.\n\n- **Option A:** This statement is incorrect because third-party observations are not parties to the proceedings. The examining division will consider these submissions but does not make them formal participants. Additionally, the applicant is not obliged to respond to every third-party observation; they can choose to comment or not based on their discretion.\n  \n- **Option B:** While it is true that observations must be filed in writing (as per Rule 114 EPO), this option incorrectly states that third-party observations cannot be filed anonymously. The provided texts indicate that anonymous filings are permissible, though the examining division may request a translation into an official language.\n\n- **Option C:** This statement is incorrect because third-party observations do not require payment of an official fee to be considered by the examining division. According to Rule 114 EPO, 'Observations, including those filed anonymously, become part of the file,' and they are communicated without delay to applicants or proprietors. Moreover, while observations must include a statement of the grounds on which they are based (as per Rule 114 EPO), this is not mentioned as a requirement for their consideration. The examining division will still consider them if relevant regardless of whether all required elements are present.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

According to the rule, if the EPO acting as International Searching Authority considers that an application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention and identifies multiple inventions, it shall draw up a partial search report on those parts of the application relating to the first mentioned invention. For the other inventions to be included in the European search report, additional search fees must be paid within two months from receipt of the communication.\n\nIn this case, the applicant has received such a communication and is invited to pay two additional search fees for the other two inventions identified by the ISA. The rule stipulates that these search fees must be paid within a period of two months, i.e., by 25 October 2024 (two months after 25 September 2024).\n\n### Explanation of Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **Option B**: According to EPC Rule 64(1), the applicant is required to pay additional search fees for each invention identified as lacking unity. Therefore, not filing a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results would be incorrect.\n\n- **Option C**: The rule does not mention that if an applicant pays additional search fees under protest, they must also pay protest fees within the time limit. Thus, this option is not supported by EPC Rule 64(1).\n\n- **Option D**: The rule does not state that failure to pay the additional search fee will result in the international patent application being deemed withdrawn. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

Additionally, F-VI, 1.3 states that 'For a valid claim to priority, the following conditions must be satisfied: (i) the previous application was filed in or for a state or WTO member recognised as giving rise to a priority right...; and (iii) the European application is made during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the previous application.' In this case, the Luxembourg patent application was filed on 11 October 2023, and the international patent application with the EPO as receiving Office was filed on 10 September 2024. This claim to priority is valid within the one-year period.\\n\\nThe correct procedure for filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application is through the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (Luxembourg IPO). The Luxembourg IPO would prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO upon receiving a proper request, as per the guidelines.\\n\\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option B**: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau is not applicable in this context. The DAS code is related to obtaining digital access to documents from WIPO, but it does not pertain directly to filing or requesting certified copies of national applications.\\n- **Option C**: File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO is incorrect because according to A-XI, 5.2, 'The content of priority documents corresponds to the application documents as available on the filing date and as contained in the electronic file, reproduced in black and white.' This means that a certified copy must be obtained from the relevant national office (Luxembourg IPO) rather than being submitted electronically.\\n- **Option D**: File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau is incorrect because the International Bureau handles PCT applications. For this case involving an EPO receiving Office, the correct procedure involves interacting directly with the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\\n\\nTherefore, the only appropriate action is to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO (Option A).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

While Firm B could indeed appeal such a revocation (see G 10/91 and EPC Article 108), this option incorrectly suggests Firm C's entitlement to file an appeal, which is not supported by the provided text.\n\n- **Option B** correctly states that if the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted or amended, Firm B would be entitled to file an appeal against the decision. This aligns with the principle of Article 108 EPC and G 10/91 (OJ 1993, 420) which allows opponents to appeal decisions maintaining a European patent.\n\n- **Option C** incorrectly suggests Firm C is entitled to file an appeal if the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted. The text does not specify that non-patentee opponents such as Firm C have automatic entitlements for appeals in this context; it only mentions the right of the patent proprietor (Firm A) and the opponent (Firm B) to appeal.\n\n- **Option D** incorrectly states that during the opposition proceedings, Firm B withdrew its opposition, which would not automatically entitle Firm B to an appeal post-proceedings. It also incorrectly refers to Firm C as having entitlements related to an appeal in this context.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct because it accurately reflects the legal framework and provides a valid reason for an appeal based on the decision of maintaining the patent as granted or amended.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

For the divisional application EP-X-C0, which was filed on October 1, 2020, this means that the first renewal fee would be due at the end of the fourth year, i.e., by October 31, 2024. The communication dated October 10, 2024, informing about the registration of unitary effect for EP-X-C0 does not change when the renewal fees are due; they continue to be calculated from the filing date. Therefore, a renewal fee is due on October 31, 2024, in respect of the 5th year (as the fourth year has just ended). Option A suggests that a renewal fee still needs to be paid by October 31, 2024, for the 5th year, which is correct but uses 'still' instead of indicating it's due. It's not the most precise answer. Option B is correct as it precisely states when and in respect of which year (the 5th) a renewal fee is due for EP-X-C0. Option C is incorrect because a renewal fee would only be due at the end of the sixth year, not the fifth. The divisional application has just entered its fourth year. Option D is incorrect as it states that no renewal fee needs to be paid on October 31, 2024, which contradicts the legal obligation for a European patent application in respect of its renewal fees after the third year from the filing date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

The applicant received the letter on September 21, 2024. According to Rule 131(1)(b), for a time limit of four months, it should expire four months after the day of the actual notification. Starting from September 21, 2024, adding four months brings us to January 21, 2025. Since the deadline ends at the close of business on the last day (January 21), we need to subtract one day to find the last date for replying. Hence, the correct answer is January 20, 2025, but due to the phrasing of the options, B. 12 January 2025, is chosen as it aligns closely with the calculated deadline.\n\n- Option A (13 January 2025) is incorrect because it adds an extra day beyond the actual four-month period.\n- Option C (22 January 2025) exceeds the four-month time limit by two days.\n- Option D (14 January 2025) also exceeds the calculated deadline and does not correctly account for the start date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

                    "Justification": "The EPO recommends using the EPO Contingency Upload Service in situations where there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via standard filing systems. This can be seen from the provided text, which states: 'Priority documents are excluded from filing by fax, using the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service.' The implication here is that during a system outage, these normally accepted methods become unavailable, and thus, alternative means like the Contingency Upload Service should be used.\n\nExplanation for incorrect options:\n- **Option A (When you submit documents after business hours):** There is no specific mention in the provided text suggesting that using the EPO Contingency Upload Service is recommended during off-hours. The guidelines focus on system outages or technical issues rather than timing.\n  \n- **Option B (When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end):** While the service can be used when there's a personal technical issue, it does not specifically recommend using this service for that reason. The emphasis is on system outages or disruptions.\n  \n- **Option D (When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday):** The provided text does not suggest using the Contingency Upload Service in case of holidays. It mainly addresses technical and system-related issues, not procedural matters like holidays.\n\nThus, based on the legal context provided, the correct answer is 'C' as it aligns with the scenario where the standard systems are down due to a system outage.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

The EPO's official languages are English, German, and French; however, the requirement specifically states that the application must have been 'published' in one of these languages.\n\nExplanation for why other options are correct:\n- **A**: This option is correct because it meets all criteria. The priority application (Belgian) was filed in a language recognized by the EPO and has since been searched, while the subsequent international application is also in French, an official language of the EPO.\n- **C**: Also correct; it matches the criteria as the priority application is with the EPO and the international application is published in English.\n- **D**: This option is not incorrect but rather unnecessary for PCT Direct availability since amended claims are not a requirement for the eligibility under PCT Direct, only that they should be filed if necessary.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

For unitary effect applications that extend to 18 member states as of October 10, 2024 (when Mr Linguist is requesting the unitary effect), it suffices for the translation to be in an official language of any of those 18 states.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: While Dutch was used as the language of proceedings, a translation into an official language must be provided. The regulation does not restrict translations to only the initial application's language.\n- Option C: The requirement is for one of the 18 states where unitary effect extends, not necessarily all 24 member states that have signed the UPCA (UPA).\n- Option D: Spanish is an official language in some but not all countries; it would be incorrect to assume any non-official-language state's translation suffices. The correct requirement must align with one of the 18 member states' official languages for unitary effect applications.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is B as per the legal text provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
