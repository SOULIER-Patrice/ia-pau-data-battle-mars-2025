The rule does not require consent from the erroneously designated inventor (in this case, Ms Smith) for such a correction as long as it is done before publication or by the time the technical preparations are completed. Since no opposition was filed and the patent has only just been granted, the technical preparations have likely not yet begun, allowing the proprietor to make the necessary corrections.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Although no proceedings are pending at this moment, the EPO can still take action to correct the inventor designation based on Rule 60 before publication or upon the completion of technical preparations for publication.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While it might be common practice in some jurisdictions to require consent from all inventors for changes like deleting a name, there is no such requirement under EPC rules. The proprietor can unilaterally make corrections based on Rule 60 as long as the necessary time frame has not been exceeded.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: As explained above, the EPO allows correction by the patent proprietor without needing consent from the erroneously designated inventor when making such changes before publication or during technical preparations.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html"

Once the six-month period from the publication of the European search report has passed without a request for examination being filed, the application is deemed withdrawn.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Missing the time limit for filing the application within the priority period cannot be remedied after the deadline, as it leads to the loss of priority rights permanently under Article 123(2) EPC. Filing an application beyond the priority period will not allow the original filing date to be restored.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Missing the time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights cannot be remedied through requesting re-establishment, as this is a separate and paid procedure under Rule 136 EPC.

The power of attorney already granted by Greta for representation before the DPMA would cover his actions before other bodies, including the EPO if they are recognized representatives in those capacities.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: While it is generally advisable that the demand for international preliminary examination is signed by either the applicant or an authorized representative (such as Hassan), there is no explicit mandatory requirement under the PCT that it must be signed specifically by Greta or Hassan. The primary condition is that the signature should be from a person duly authorized to act on behalf of the applicant.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: According to Article 13(2) of the PCT, an international application can be withdrawn by either the applicant or an agent authorized by the applicant with a power of attorney.

Since Mr Van Holland requested examination in Dutch but has not yet provided the required English translation for EP -div, filing both the English translation and a request for further processing would correct this deficiency.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it's true that within two months of notification under Rule 112(1) EPC, Mr Van Holland could file an English translation to remedy the situation, this option does not specify the requirement to also submit a request for further processing. The EPO would require both actions.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: It states that the deficiency cannot be remedied, which is false because filing the necessary documents (English translation and request for further processing) can correct the deficiency.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Although re-establishment of rights might apply to other scenarios not present in this case, it is not the appropriate action here since the application has merely not been accompanied by a required English translation, which can be remedied directly.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html"

Renewal fees must be paid centrally to the EPO, not separately in each state where the patent is validated. Furthermore, while Rule 129(4) EPC allows for a grace period until the end of January (specifically, until 30 days after the due date), it does not apply to patents granted with mention in only two states, and the correct renewal fee due date based on centralized payment is by 16 December 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

The question does not indicate any specific restrictions that would make the EPO incompatible with choosing the USPTO as well.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The Austrian Patent Office can indeed serve as a designated Office for applications filed via the PCT route, but it is not typically considered an IPEA or ISA due to its geographical location and language. Choosing the Austrian Patent Office does not align with common practice and would be outside the scope of standard PCT designations.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore is not a designated Office for applications filed via the Euro-PCT route, meaning it cannot be chosen as an ISA or IPEA. This choice is invalid under the terms set by the PCT and would not comply with the applicant's obligations to adhere to standard PCT designations.\n\nIn summary, Company M can validly choose the EPO as its ISA and the USPTO as its IPEA, making option A the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, a valid claim to priority must be made during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the previous application (subject to certain exceptions). In this case, applicant P filed an international patent application PCT-P on June 20, 2023, claiming priority from European patent application EP-I filed on July 7, 2022. Since the deadline for adding a valid priority claim is within twelve months of the filing date of the previous application, which in this case is July 7, 2022, the time limit for adding the missing priority claim from EP-II would be until July 3, 2023 + 1 day (to include the filing day). Therefore, today being October 12, 2023, it indicates that the deadline has already passed. However, the question asks if the time limit for adding the priority claim still expires on November 3, 2023, which is within the twelve-month period from July 7, 2022. Hence, the answer is A.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The deadline would not be extended beyond the initial twelve-month period starting from July 7, 2022.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: October 20, 2023, is after the initial twelve-month period for adding a valid priority claim.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The time limit for adding the priority claim expired on July 3, 2023, and it cannot be extended.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "D",
                    "Justification": "- Option A is incorrect because the opponent/respondent has not exceeded the given period for filing comments. The four-month period for commenting ended on 10 April 2024 (1 June 2023 + 4 months = 10 April 2024), and there was no extension requested by the board of appeal. Since the opponent/respondent has timely submitted their comments, they do not need to request an extension.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because the submission of a timely comment does not inherently require payment for further processing unless otherwise specified by the patent office or the board's rules. The fee would be due only if there was additional procedural action required from the opponent/respondent that necessitated such a fee, which in this case, filing comments within the given period does not.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because no reestablishment of rights is necessary as long as the appeal and subsequent comments were filed on time. The patent proprietor has filed an appeal in time, and the opponent/respondent has timely submitted their comments without any delay or request for extension that would necessitate a reestablishment of rights.\n\n- Option D correctly identifies that none of the other actions are required given the facts provided: the opponent/respondent is within the filing period for comments.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html"

Renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional 50% fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest, as per the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3. Since proceedings were interrupted on March 10, 2022, and renewed on October 12, 2023, the third year's renewal fee (due from March 2022 to March 2023) is now overdue and must be paid with a late payment fee. The fourth year's renewal fee (due from March 2023 to March 2024) is also due but can still be paid before it falls out of grace, i.e., by April 30, 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The application is not deemed withdrawn just because no renewal fees have been paid; it remains active until the deadline for payment is missed and a late fee is incurred.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Renewal fees cannot be validly paid without any additional fee by 12 October 2023, as this date falls within the grace period where an additional 50% fee must be paid to ensure validity of payment.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The renewal fees for both the third and fourth years can only be validly paid with an additional 50% late fee by April 30, 2024, not by October 31, 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

Since a request for early processing has been filed and it's already 25 months after the filing date (which is within the 31-month period), the CN applicant needs to complete Form 1200 and pay the filing fee and search fee, as required by Rule 48(1)(a) PCT. No renewal fees are due at this stage.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The third-year renewal fee is not applicable yet since only 25 months have passed from the filing date, which means it is still within the first five years of the application period when no annual renewal fees are required for PCT applications (Rule 109(3) and Rule 116 PCT).\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** There is no requirement to appoint a representative just because an early processing request has been filed. Appointment of a representative would be necessary if the applicant wished to engage legal counsel or another representative, but this is not mandatory for early processing.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Since A accurately reflects the required actions based on the given circumstances, options B, C, and D are not correct in this context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not directly relate to the time frame for withdrawing the application and obtaining a refund of the designation fee; it refers to a different timeline within the patent process.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While the designation fee was validly paid, Rule 71a(6) specifies that refunds can be granted under certain conditions, one of which is the option to withdraw the application before the six-month period ends.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The date of the start of substantive examination does not pertain to the time frame for withdrawing an application and requesting a refund of the designation fee; it refers to the stage in the patent process when detailed examination begins after the search report has been sent.\n  \nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as per Rule 71a(6) guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

However, an applicant can still make changes or corrections before the debit order is executed. In this case, since the notice was given on 10 October 2024, which is within the period before the execution date of 18 October 2024, the order to debit the renewal fee could be revoked. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order would be 10 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The option suggests a date before the notice was given, which means the change couldn't have been made in time.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: This date is after the execution date and thus too late to make any changes.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it's true that a debit order cannot be partially revoked once executed, the option incorrectly states this cannot happen at all before execution. In this case, partial revocation was possible before the execution date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

The time limit for filing such an appeal is four months from notification of the decision, making option A valid.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is correct:** Under Article 134 EPC and Rule 102(1) EPC, an applicant can request further processing within two months from the date of the refusal decision. This provides a means to extend the time limit for filing documents that were missed due to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is correct:** Article 122 EPC and Rule 136 EPC allow applicants to request re-establishment of rights if they can prove exceptional circumstances leading to non-compliance with a deadline. In this case, the applicant did not file the designation of inventor within the given time limit, making it relevant to request re-establishment.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is correct:** As all options A, B, and C are valid actions the applicant can take, option D encompassing all these choices is also correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_1_2.html"

According to the text, such persons may not be parties to the proceedings.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Option B states that \"Third-party observations must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously.\" While it's true that third-party observations must be in writing (as stated), there is no information provided suggesting they cannot be filed anonymously. In fact, the text mentions that \"Observations may be filed anonymously,\" which contradicts option B.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The statement that an \"official fee is paid\" to consider third-party observations is not mentioned in the given text and does not align with the provided information.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

Typically, this period is within two months or such other time as may be stated in the invitation. In this case, the date for responding would be 25 October 2024 (two months from 25 September 2024).\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: You are required to pay the additional search fees within the specified time limit and should also review and possibly respond to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results, even if you do not agree with it. Ignoring or protesting without following the procedural steps could result in adverse actions against your application.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While you may choose to pay protest fees if you disagree with the ISA's decision, this is an additional step and not a mandatory requirement for simply paying the additional search fees as requested. The statement about paying two protest fees within the time limit is not supported by EPO guidelines.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, your application will not be deemed to have been withdrawn but may face further actions such as being examined only on one invention (the first identified in the application) or having deficiencies noted against it. The application does not automatically withdraw unless explicitly stated by the ISA through a formal notice of deemed withdrawal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

It cannot be used to obtain a certified copy from another country's national office.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Filing an electronic certified copy directly with the EPO does not follow the PCT procedures for obtaining priority certificates, as it bypasses the step of requesting the original document from the relevant national patent office.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The International Bureau itself does not prepare or provide certified copies of documents; this responsibility lies with the respective national patent offices.

Thus, it is Firm B who can file an appeal against a decision to revoke the patent.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect as Firm C, although having submitted observations, was not a party to the opposition proceedings and therefore does not have standing to file an appeal based on the information given.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because while Firm B did withdraw its opposition during the proceedings, there is no indication that it filed any further arguments or requests.

This would imply that the unitary effect registration had no impact on the timing of the renewal fees, which contradicts the fact that unitary effect was registered on the same date as the grant publication.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The statement suggests a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 6th year for EP -X-C0. This would be incorrect because, with unitary effect registration and considering that the first renewal period starts from 1 October 2023, the fifth year (which ends on 30 September 2024) is the correct period for which the renewal fee needs to be paid by 31 October 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The statement suggests that no renewal fee has to be paid on 31 October 2024. This would imply there are no outstanding fees due, which contradicts the requirement for payment as per the EPC regulations and the given timeline.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

Standard filing procedures should be sufficient in these circumstances.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If the EPO is closed due to an official holiday, standard filing services would not be available anyway.

Since Mr Linguist is seeking immediate registration in all 18 states that are parties to the Unitary Patent Package Agreement (UPCA), he must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of these 18 states, making option B correct.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The European Patent Convention does not permit translations into national languages unless specifically stated. In this case, Dutch would not be acceptable as it pertains to only the Netherlands and not all 18 states with unitary effect.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The UPCA covers a list of countries that have signed or acceded to the agreement. While Mr Linguist must ensure his translation complies with the conditions for these specific states, providing a translation in an official language of any state that has not signed the UPCA would be unnecessary and potentially redundant.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Spanish is one of the languages that can be used as part of unitary effect registration according to Rule 81(3) of the EPC. However, it must still be an official language of a state for which unitary effect is being requested, not just any language like Spanish. Thus, merely stating \"Spanish\" is insufficient and does not fulfill the requirement.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"
