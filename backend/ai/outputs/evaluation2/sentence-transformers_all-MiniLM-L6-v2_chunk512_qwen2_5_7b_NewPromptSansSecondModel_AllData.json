Therefore, based on the information given and considering that none of Lithuania, France, or Italy are mentioned as having such provisions, the answer is \"None of the above.\"\n\n- **Why A is incorrect:** There is no specific mention of Lithuania's patent law or its relationship with the PCT in the provided context. \n\n- **Why B is incorrect:** Similarly, there is no information about France’s direct entry procedures from an international application to a national phase.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect:** Italy is not mentioned specifically either, and without additional details on Italian national patents or their relationship with the PCT, it cannot be concluded that Italy allows direct national phase entry.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Article 2, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a2.html\nSource: PCT Article 4, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a4.html\nSource: PCT Article 45, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a45.html\nSource: PCT Article 2, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a2.html\nSource: PCT Rule 4, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r4.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why D is correct. Article 23(2) PCT states that for early entry into the European phase, the application must be designated as a European patent application and the necessary fees paid within the prescribed time limit. The minimum requirements to validly effect early entry are payment of the designation fee and examination fee, which aligns with option D.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. While claims fees may eventually be required, they do not need to be paid immediately for early entry into the European phase.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Although it includes all necessary fees as in option D plus additional fees like claims and renewal, these are not strictly required at the time of early entry according to Article 23(2) PCT.\n\n- Payment of the filing fee (option A) is not a requirement for early entry under Article 23(2) PCT. It pertains more generally to the initial filing process rather than the specific conditions for early entry into the European phase.\n  \nThus, D correctly identifies the minimum requirements for validly effecting early entry into the European phase according to Article 23(2) PCT.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, B.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_b_6_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 161, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r161.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "- **D is correct**: According to EPC Rule 71(7), if the applicant fails to pay the claims fees due before the European patent is granted, the application is deemed withdrawn. This implies that the withdrawal can be effective up until one day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin (EP Bull). Therefore, D represents the last point in time for an effective withdrawal.\n\n- **B is incorrect**: The dates mentioned here refer to the requirements set by Rule 67(1) and (2), which pertain to when technical preparations are completed and whether publication should occur. They do not determine the period during which a patent application can be effectively withdrawn.\n\n- **C is incorrect**: The date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin signifies that the application has already been granted, thus making it impossible for an effective withdrawal to take place on or after this date. \n\n- **A is incorrect**: There is no specific reference in EPC Rule 71(3) to a communication related to the claims fees being the last point of withdrawal. The rule primarily concerns the request for payment and the consequences if the fee is not paid, but does not set an exact deadline for withdrawal.\n\nThus, D accurately captures the latest possible time for an effective withdrawal based on the EPC rules provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 70b, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r70b.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 7.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_7_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_10.html"

However, such corrections are not made without prior notice and are published in the European Patent Bulletin, with the sole purpose of bringing the specification into line with the content of the decision to grant. Rule 143(2) EPC specifically mentions that these corrections must be done under the circumstances where opposition proceedings are pending or during the opposition period.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement \"This error in the published specification of this European patent may be corrected at any time\" is too broad and does not take into account the specific conditions for correction as outlined by Rule 143(2) EPC. \n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The statement \"The error may only be corrected if opposition proceedings are pending\" is also too restrictive. According to Rule 143(2), corrections can be made even during the opposition period, not just when opposition proceedings are already in place.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The statement \"This error in the published specification of this European patent may never be corrected\" contradicts the provisions under Rule 143(2) EPC which allow for correction as soon as any mistake is found.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.8.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_8_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 73, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r73.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_11.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if you find missing parts such as page 3 of the description and claims 7-12 after filing your application, you can file these at any time up to two months from the filing date without re-dating the application (Rule 58(2) in the EPO Rules). Since the filing date for EP-A is 27 October 2022, you have until 30 December 2022 to file the missing parts. Given that the notice was received on 3 November 2022 and there are still fees unpaid as of this date, it is within your rights to file these additional pages voluntarily before 2 January 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: While it is true that the EPO might invite you to file missing parts under Rule 58(1), this action is optional and not mandatory. The invitation itself does not automatically trigger a two-month time limit; rather, if you decide to act upon such an invitation, then you have two months to submit the required documents.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: You cannot add new claims at any time based on existing descriptions without following proper procedures. Claims need to be supported by the description as they exist in the original filing date document (EP-A), and any additional claims must derive from that version for compliance with Rule 123(2) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Withdrawing EP-A would not solve the problem, as it still does not address the issue of missing content. Furthermore, re-filing while claiming priority from FR-A might unnecessarily complicate matters and delay the application process without addressing the current situation with the missing pages in EP-A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-IV, 2.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iv_2_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html"

According to Rule 21(1) EPC, a designation error can be corrected upon request and with the consent of the wrongly designated person; however, if such a request is made by a third party (in this case, the patent proprietor), the consent of the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent is required. Since Mr. Li was erroneously added as an inventor and Ms. Smith needs to be corrected, the patent proprietor can make the correction with her consent.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Even though no opposition proceedings are pending, the patent proprietor still has the right to correct errors in the inventorship according to Rule 21(1) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The statement that \"needs Mr Li's consent for this\" is not accurate because under Rule 21(1) EPC, the patent proprietor can make the correction with the consent of Ms Smith (or in this case, her withdrawal).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. While it is true that a designation cannot be changed without the consent of the wrongly designated inventor (in this case, Ms Smith), since Mr Li was erroneously added as an inventor and needs to be removed, the patent proprietor can make the correction with the consent of Ms Smith but does not need her active approval for the removal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, C.2.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_2_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 1.2.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_1_2_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.3.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_3_7.html"

This step ensures that Y has legal standing to act on behalf of the applicant in relation to the European patent application EP -A.\n\n**Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect:**\n- **Option B**: While it correctly mentions requesting a change of representative and filing a response by 12 October 2023 at the latest, it omits the crucial step of having an authorization signed by the applicant.

The context provided mentions that specific time limits such as those related to paying fees or requesting examination must be addressed through other mechanisms, like requesting further processing (Option A and B) or filing a new application (Option C). However, for time limits relating to the filing of an application within the priority period, re-establishment of rights is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, option C is correct as it aligns with the context provided.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) requires filing a request for examination within a specified time limit and does not allow for re-establishment of rights if this deadline is missed (Option B).\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: The guidelines mention that time limits such as paying the designation fee can be remedied by requesting further processing through a specific procedure, which is different from re-establishment of rights. Thus, paying the designation fee cannot be addressed via re-establishment of rights (Option A).\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself does not fall under the time limits that can be remedied through this mechanism. The context provided specifies that re-establishment of rights addresses missed filing deadlines, which includes the time limit for filing the application within the priority period (Option C). Hence, paying a separate fee to re-establish rights is not relevant here (Option D). \n\nThus, the correct answer is Option C: Time limit for filing the application within the priority period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

Since Greta and Hassan are resident in Germany (DPMA), Hassan as her representative can act before the EPO if it acts as the International Searching Authority for application PCT-G.\n  \n- **Explanation of why B is correct:** Article 16 of the PCT requires that an agent acting on behalf of the applicant must be properly authorized. Thus, Hassan would need to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta in order to act before the EPO.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is correct:** Article 23(4) of the PCT states that an international application can only be withdrawn with the consent of the applicant or the applicant’s representative. Since Hassan has been appointed as Greta's representative, he is authorized to make such a decision on her behalf if she consents.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The requirement for the demand for international preliminary examination does not necessarily need to be signed by the applicant themselves or their agent with a power of attorney. It can be filed through the appointed representative as long as the representative has proper authorization and the necessary documentation, such as a power of attorney, is in place. Article 19(3) of the PCT states that the demand for international preliminary examination can be made by any person representing the applicant, provided they are properly authorized to do so, which would include Hassan in this case given his power of attorney from Greta.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_3_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_1.html\nSource: PCT Article 34, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a34.html\nSource: EPC Rule 161, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r161.html\nSource: PCT Article 16, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a16.html"

The case provided does not specify any such agreement between Andorra (a small state with a bilateral agreement with the EPO) and Spain. Therefore, if this scenario fits the criteria under the relevant bilateral agreement or multilateral convention, A could be correct. However, based on the given information, it is assumed that the declaration of entitlement by crossing the relevant box on Form 1001 would confirm the right to the fee reduction.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While a German firm may employ a significant number of people and have high turnover, there is no general rule for reducing fees based on the size or economic status of the applicant. The question specifies that only declarations by natural persons (crossing relevant boxes on Form 1001) are considered under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: A natural person who is a resident and national of another country, even if filing in French, does not automatically qualify for fee reductions unless there is an agreement between the applicant’s home country (USA) and the EPO. The scenario provided only mentions the nationality and residence without any indication of such an agreement.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to C, a Swiss national would not generally be entitled to a reduction under Rule 6 EPC unless there was an agreement between Switzerland and the EPO. There are no special provisions for Swiss applicants in this context as per the information provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 58, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a58.html\nSource: EPC Article 75, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a75.html\nSource: EPC Rule 152, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r152.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_4.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html"

The filing of the translation alone within the prescribed period should resolve the issue without additional requests.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: There is no indication in Rule 112 or other relevant rules that a request for re-establishment of rights would be necessary in this scenario; simply filing the required English translation will suffice.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

The due date mentioned in the communication from the EPO is 30 November 2023 (the day after the patent grant was published in the European Patent Bulletin). Since today is 12 October 2023, and the renewal fee can still be validly paid within six months of this date without an additional fee, 30 November 2023 falls within that timeframe.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The due date for the fourth year renewal fee is not 16 November 2023 but 30 November 2023, as stated in the communication from the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why C and D are incorrect: The patent will be validated only in two contracting states. According to Rule 51(3) EPC, a renewal fee that was due prior to the filing of a divisional application can still be paid without an additional fee within four months after the grant. Therefore, the renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated, but it can be validly paid until 9 January 2024 at the latest (four months from 16 November 2023).

This ensures that any modifications comply fully with the EPC requirements.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: The requirement mentioned in option A (to publish a new specification and to file translations of the claims) may not always be applicable if only minor amendments have been made. Moreover, there's no necessity for filing translations of the claims just because of handwritten amendments; this would generally apply under different circumstances.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B incorrectly states that these documents are unnecessary during appeal proceedings. The EPO guidelines require compliance with formalities even if an appeal is pending, as the amended patent must still meet all requirements of the EPC.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: While option D correctly identifies a requirement to file a typed version of the amended paragraph, it incorrectly limits this obligation to cases where no appeal is filed. The requirement applies regardless of whether an appeal has been filed or not.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-IV, 5.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iv_5_3.html"

Form 1226CC pertains to filing amendments before the supplementary European search report is drawn up, which is relevant when there has been an international preliminary examination request and subsequent amendments have been filed with the EPO upon entry into the regional phase. This scenario does not fit because no request for IPER was made.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Form 1226AC indicates that the examination has already started, which would only be sent after a reply to the communication under Rule 161/162 EPC has been received or if no response was given and a period had passed.

Since the application was filed in Spanish, which is a non-official language of the EPO, Company M would have to provide a translation into one of the official languages of the EPO within two months after filing. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The USPTO cannot be chosen as an ISA for a PCT application filed with IMPI because it does not act as an ISA; its role would only come into play if selected as an IPEA in cooperation with another ISA.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: While the Austrian Patent Office (APO) can indeed serve as an ISA, the EPO cannot be chosen simultaneously as an IPEA for a PCT application filed through IMPI due to the specific roles and jurisdictions involved. Typically, only one office from each region (ISA/UE or ISA/Non-UE) is selected per PCT application.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore cannot be chosen as an IPEA for a PCT application filed through IMPI because it does not serve as the designated authority for international patent applications.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

The deadline for adding a missing claim to priority in this case would be 16 months after the earliest filing date of EP-II, which is 3 July 2022. Therefore, the time limit expires on 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect.\n  Option A suggests that the deadline is on 3 November 2023, which aligns with the correct calculation but mistakenly includes it in option A itself rather than as an explanation for B's correctness. The time limit must be derived from the earliest filing date claimed (EP-II), not PCT-P.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect.\n  Option C proposes a deadline on 20 October 2023, which incorrectly suggests that the applicant has less than two months to add the priority claim. This timeframe would have expired much earlier and does not align with EPC Article 88(1) or Rule 17.2 PCT.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.\n  Option D claims that the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023, which is incorrect as it would mean the applicant had only one month from the earliest filing date to add the claim, significantly less than the legally prescribed 16 months.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

The opponent/respondent filed their comments on 12 October 2023, which is outside the initially specified period of four months.

The EPC does not specify any additional fees for extending the comment period unless explicitly mentioned in other rules or practices which are not applicable here.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Reestablishment of rights due to non-payment of fees is not relevant here since the issue is timing of comments and not payment of fees.

Since proceedings have been resumed today (12 October 2023), the third-year renewal fee is due by 20 March 2024, and can be paid without an additional fee up to that date. Therefore, the applicant can validly pay the third and fourth years' renewal fees on 12 October 2023 at the latest.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The application will not be deemed withdrawn just because no renewal fees have been paid. According to Rule 51(2) EPC, there are still timeframes within which the renewal fee can be paid without incurring additional fees or causing the application to be withdrawn.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** While it might seem plausible that an additional fee could be required after a certain point, Rule 51(2) EPC clearly states that for the third and fourth years, no additional fee is needed up until the due date (20 March 2024). Therefore, paying by 30 April 2024 would exceed the last valid payment period without an additional fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The applicant can pay the renewal fees for both the third and fourth years on or before 20 March 2024 without any additional fee. Paying by 31 October 2023 would be too early, as this date does not align with either year's due dates under Rule 51(2) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Why A is correct**: \n  Since an international application has been published with the search report by CNIPA and a request for early processing has been filed, the applicant needs to comply with Rule 159 of the EPC. According to this rule, the applicant should complete and file Form 1200 (as per B-VI, 4.1.2) and pay the filing fee and search fee within 25 months from the filing date (Rule 159(1)(c)). There is no indication that a third-year renewal fee or appointing a representative is necessary given the provided information.\n\n- **Why B is incorrect**: \n  While paying the search fee as in option A is correct, there is no evidence to suggest that the renewal fee for the third year (Rule 159(1)(g)) needs to be paid at this stage. The requirement for a third-year renewal fee typically arises when the full 31-month period has passed without the applicant having taken steps to enter the European phase, which is not the case here.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: \n  Appointing a representative (Rule 159(1)(h)) is not indicated as an essential action in this scenario. The question specifies that no priority has been claimed and there are no more than 35 pages and 15 claims, which do not typically necessitate appointing a representative unless the applicant specifically requests one.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect**: \n  Option D states \"None of the above statements,\" but as we have determined that option A correctly identifies the necessary actions based on the given information, this choice is incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, a 50% refund of the examination fee can be obtained if the application is withdrawn after substantive examination has begun but before the expiry of the (extended) time limit for replying to the first invitation under Article 94(3), which includes communications related to deemed withdrawal. In this case, the latest point in time for withdrawing the application would be six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The date of mention of the publication of the European search report marks a key deadline but does not allow for a refund; it is the period following this that permits withdrawal and, potentially, a partial refund.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While the designation fee was validly paid upon filing within the month, it can still be refunded according to the guidelines if the application is withdrawn by the specified deadline after substantive examination has begun.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The date of the start of substantive examination is not relevant for determining when a refund may be obtained as per the EPO's guidelines; it is instead the timeline related to deemed withdrawal and subsequent actions that matter in this context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

In this scenario, the execution date is 18 October 2024, so the order can be revoked on 17 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. Revoking the order after filing it on 10 October 2024 does not allow for part revocation; it would need to be entirely cancelled or left as is until the execution date.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The latest point in time for revocation cannot be the same day as the execution date because that would leave no room for revoking any part of the order.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The ADA does permit partial revocation, which means a specific period exists during which parts of the order can still be altered or cancelled prior to the specified execution date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html"

More importantly, they can file a request for re-establishment of rights under Article 122 EPC (Option C), as the non-observance of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor directly caused the refusal of the application.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B refers to filing a request for further processing, which is not specifically mentioned in the context provided. In such situations, further processing would typically be requested if there was an administrative error or incomplete communication from the European Patent Office, but it is not directly related to re-establishment of rights due to missed time limits.\n\n- **Explanation of why A and C are correct**: Both filing a notice of appeal (Option A) and requesting re-establishment of rights (Option C) are valid actions that can be taken by the applicant. Therefore, D is the most comprehensive answer encompassing all possible remedies.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_9.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: EPC Article 122, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a122.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why D is correct:**  \n  Statement D is accurate according to the provided guidelines. Third-party observations can indeed be filed after the publication of a European patent application, and they must be submitted in an official language of the EPO as per Rule 114(1) and (2) in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:**  \n  Option A states that the person filing third-party observations will be a party to the proceedings, which is not true. Third parties are merely submitting observations and do not become part of the proceedings as participants or parties. Additionally, it incorrectly suggests that the applicant must respond to all third-party observations, which is not a mandatory requirement; the examining division may consider the observations without requiring an immediate response from the applicant.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:**  \n  Option B claims that third-party observations cannot be filed anonymously, which contradicts Article 115 and Rule 114(1) in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO. These provisions explicitly allow for the filing of anonymous observations.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:**  \n  Statement C asserts that an official fee must be paid, but this is not mentioned or required by any of the provided guidelines or rules. Third-party observations are considered part of the examination process and are accepted without payment as per Rule 114(2) in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO. Furthermore, the statements about grounds on which they are based (Rule 3(3)) do not require a fee to be paid. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

In this case, since you have been invited to pay two additional search fees, and considering the time limit provided (two months from the date of communication), you must ensure these payments by 25 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: EPC Rule 64(1) requires you to respond to the communication issued by the ISA. The provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results should be considered as part of your response, even if it does not explicitly require action on all points raised in the communication.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While paying a fee under protest means you believe the requirement was unjustified, EPC Rule 64(2) states that any fee paid under paragraph 1 will be refunded if the Examining Division finds that the communication was not justified. Thus, there is no obligation to pay two protest fees within the time limit.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: According to EPC Rule 64, non-payment of additional search fees does not automatically result in the withdrawal of the international patent application. Instead, it requires a response from you, which could include paying the required fees or providing arguments as to why unity of invention has been complied with.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau would be used for obtaining documents from other WIPO offices or members, not specifically from Luxembourg's office in this context.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect.

Therefore, Firm B would be entitled to file an appeal in scenario A.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement \"At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to and firm B are entitled to file an appeal\" is incomplete and does not specify whether the division decided to maintain or revoke the patent. Hence, it cannot be considered correct based on the information provided in the question.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Firm C filed observations under Article 115 EPC but did not initiate opposition proceedings. Therefore, Firm C has no right to appeal a decision made by the opposition division regarding the maintenance or revocation of the patent.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it is true that during the opposition proceedings, Firm B withdrew its opposition, and at the end of the proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted, this scenario does not provide any basis for Firm B to file an appeal against the decision. An appeal can only be filed by a party who has directly opposed the patent, which in this case is Firm B itself, not Firm C.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

Options C and D do not exist in this context, so they cannot provide a justification for an incorrect answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_2.html\nSource: EPC RFees 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f14.html"

This requirement ensures that only valid and registered licences are eligible for further licensing through sub-licensing.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because, as explained above, there is no absolute prohibition on recording sub-licences; they can be recorded under certain conditions, specifically when the original licence has been previously registered in the European Patent Register. Thus, it is not impossible to record a sub-licence if all necessary prerequisites are met.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it overgeneralizes and does not reflect the specific condition required for recording a sub-licence as per EPC Rule 24(b). The rule specifies that the granting of a sub-licence must be preceded by the registration of the original licensee's licence in the European Patent Register. Therefore, not all sub-licences can be recorded without this prior step being completed.\n\nThe correct approach is to ensure that any sub-licensing activity complies with the conditions set forth in EPC Rule 24(b) for its recording in the European Patent Register, making option C the most accurate answer based on the provided legal context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 24, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r24.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIV, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiv_6_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 73, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a73.html\nSource: EPC Article 127, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a127.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_3_1.html"

In this scenario, Company C obtains a certificate from the relevant authority after the exhibition has closed but before the four-month deadline for filing the certificate with the EPO.

However, the question specifically asks whether the certificate will be accepted by the EPO, and based on the given context, it is reasonable to infer that a properly formatted and timely filed certificate would be acceptable.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Option A incorrectly states that the certificate was not issued at the exhibition.

While it is true that the effect of surrender or lapse is ex nunc (from the date of surrender or lapse), and revocation is ex tunc (from the outset), this option does not directly address the reason for filing an opposition as stated in Rule 75 EPC, which emphasizes the continuation of rights during the period up to the surrender or lapse.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_2.html\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 84, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r84.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_5_1.html"

The amendment proposed by the proprietor to claim 2 can be classified as a clarification which is permitted under these conditions.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Although claim 2 was initially unclear, proposing an amendment specifically to address this clarity issue falls within the permissible scope of additional clarifications or corrections that do not relate directly to overcoming grounds for opposition such as novelty and inventive step.

The PACE request must be filed once the application has entered the examination phase and not before that time limit for requesting examination. Therefore, filing a PACE request after receiving the EESR does not mean the examination process will only start when the official time limit for requesting examination arrives.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect.

Furthermore, Article 28(1) allows for an applicant to request withdrawal of their application at any time prior to the publication of the international search report and the international preliminary report on patentability (if requested), effectively preventing public disclosure. Therefore, B is correct as the applicant can withdraw the application and prevent its publication at any time before it is published.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The option suggests a specific 15-day period before publication to prevent withdrawal, which does not align with the general rule allowing withdrawal anytime prior to publication. This timeframe is more restrictive than what PCT rules provide.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Option C refers to the end of day five weeks before the end of the 18th month from the priority or filing date. This deadline pertains specifically to compliance with certain procedural requirements, such as payment of fees for designated States, not to the general withdrawal and publication prevention process.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** There isn't a specific option D provided in the question, but if we consider it might be another timeframe or condition, none of the other options fit the criteria of allowing an applicant to prevent publication by withdrawing their application at any time before it is published.

Therefore, the renewal fee for the third year should be paid on or before 30 June 2022 (the end of the third year). Since payment is due in a given year without surcharge by four months after the beginning of that year, the earliest possible date to pay it would be January 2022. Thus, 2 January 2022 (option C) is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**:  \n  Entering the regional phase on 26 December 2021 does not affect the timing for payment of renewal fees until the third year begins.

                    "Justification": "- Option B is correct because according to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the Receiving Section has discretion to refuse a request for oral proceedings if it does not consider them expedient. Specifically, the guideline states that \"the competent department of the EPO may arrange for oral proceedings to take place without a request from a party if it considers this to be expedient.\" This includes scenarios where after an attempt at written clarification there are still questions or doubts which have a crucial bearing on the decision, making oral discussion necessary. Furthermore, the guideline mentions that \"the competent department will also bear in mind the need for economy,\" indicating the potential for cost considerations leading to refusal.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because it suggests that there are no further exceptions, whereas the guidelines do allow for discretion based on various factors such as the necessity of oral discussion and economic considerations.\n  \n- Option C is incorrect because the opposition division can only arrange oral proceedings if they consider it expedient themselves, not necessarily refusing them. The text specifically states that \"the opposition division may arrange for oral proceedings to take place without a request from a party,\" indicating a potential to hold such hearings but not an automatic refusal.\n  \n- Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of the Legal Division in the provided guidelines having the authority or responsibility related to refusing requests for oral proceedings. The decision-making authority appears to lie with the Receiving Section and the opposition division, as noted above. \n\nTherefore, B correctly identifies that the receiving section may refuse a request for oral proceedings based on its own discretion.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_4.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 159(1) EPC, the filing fee must be paid for entry into the European phase. The examination fee and designation fee are typically not required when the application has already been searched by the International Searching Authority (ISA), which in this case was the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Since the application has been searched by the ISA, no additional examination fee is necessary according to Rule 159(2) EPC. Also, as there is no claim to priority and the application is not exceeding a certain number of pages (which would trigger the claims fee), this option includes unnecessary fees.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Similar to B, the designation fee and renewal fee are not required in this scenario because the application has been searched by the ISA. The designation fee is only needed when entering into the European phase for countries other than those where protection was requested at the time of filing or which were designated as PCT-designated Offices.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: This option includes all the fees listed in B and C, making it unnecessarily expansive and including fees that are not required given the circumstances described.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html"

The restoration of priority right request must be filed within one month of the expiry of 31 months from the filing date of the priority right to be restored, according to Rule 157(2) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The requirement for filing a request under Rule 159(1) EPC does not pertain to the restoration of the priority right; rather it pertains to entering into the regional phase and satisfies formal requirements, such as payment of fees and providing necessary information about the international application.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The two-month period mentioned in this option refers to the time frame for filing the request for early processing under EPC Rule 159(2) or the initial entry into the regional phase, not specifically for restoring a priority right that was missed by an unintentional reason.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. This option suggests a timeline based on the international application’s filing date rather than the priority date's filing date as per the rules and guidelines related to restoration of rights in EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_3.html"

However, the question specifies that a translation is not required unless the validity of the priority claim is relevant to patentability. Therefore, option C correctly states that no translation is needed unless the validity of the priority claim is relevant to patentability.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect.  \n  Option B incorrectly suggests that a translation into one of the official EPO languages is required within two months of entering the regional phase, which is not specified in the provided guidelines and goes beyond the conditions stated for filing translations.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect.  \n  Option A incorrectly adds an additional condition about proceedings language and timeframe, which is not mentioned in the guidelines.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.  \n  Option D incorrectly states that no translation is required if a declaration is submitted that the European patent application is a complete translation of the priority application, which again overlooks the specific requirement for translations when the validity of the priority claim is relevant to patentability as stated in the guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_3_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4_4.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct:** According to the extracted guidelines and legal bases provided, if a translation of the international application is not filed at the EPO within the prescribed period (usually one month as per Rule 6(2) EPC), the applicant can still remedy this by filing the translation, requesting further processing, and paying the corresponding fee within two months of notification from the EPO. This process aligns with the provisions outlined in Rule 135 EPC, which allows for the continuation of the application proceedings even after the initial deadline has passed. Thus, option B correctly identifies the course of action that can be taken to remedy the situation.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The suggestion under option A refers to requesting reinstatement of rights under Rule 49.6 PCT. This rule is primarily concerned with situations where an applicant has missed a time limit due to force majeure, legal uncertainty, or other justified grounds. In the context provided, no such justification for missing the filing deadline was mentioned. Therefore, using Rule 49.6 PCT would not be applicable.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Option C does not provide an answer but instead seems to be a placeholder or misinterpretation, as there are only two options given in the question. \n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Similarly, option D is also non-existent within the provided context and cannot be evaluated based on the information given.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html"

The applicants for international application PCT-1 being based in Japan can themselves provide this translation and comply with the requirements.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: There is no mandatory requirement that a professional representative must always be appointed under Rule 159(1) EPC; individuals may file translations on their own as long as they meet the language requirement.\n  \n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it might be advisable to have an appropriate legal or professional representative in complex cases, Rule 159(1) does not specify that a professional or legal representative must always be appointed for all individuals. The rule focuses on the translation being provided in one of the EPO's official languages.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since PCT applicants are based in Japan and can provide the required translation themselves, there is no need to exclude this possibility. Therefore, option D (No) would be incorrect as it does not account for individual applicants' capability to comply with Rule 159(1).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_2.html\nSource: PCT Article 31, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a31.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct:\n  - Based on the information provided, FP1 and FP2 have distinct subject-matter. FP1 is related to A, while FP2 includes both A and B. Since FP1 was filed ten months earlier than FP2, it can still be used as a valid priority document for claim 1 in EP1.\n  - According to the rules on claiming priority (see Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.5), if claims are related to different embodiments of an invention, each embodiment can have its own priority date based on the appropriate prior application. In this case, claim 1 which is related only to A has a valid priority date from FP1.\n  - Claim 2 in EP1, which includes both A and B, also has a valid priority date from FP2 since it claims priority from the same document.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect:\n  - C suggests that FP1 cannot be used for claim 1 because it becomes prior art. However, the rules do not state that a subsequent application can invalidate an earlier application's priority status merely by filing a later one with overlapping or related subject-matter. Thus, FP1 remains valid as a priority document for claim 1.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect:\n  - While both claims could potentially be granted due to their respective priority dates from FP1 and FP2, the rules do not support simultaneous use of FP1 and FP2 for both claims in EP1. Claim 1 specifically relates to subject-matter A which has a valid priority date from FP1.\n\n- There is no option D provided, but if such an option were included, it would likely be incorrect because it does not reflect the correct application of the rules on claiming priority as outlined above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.4.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_4_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_1.html"
