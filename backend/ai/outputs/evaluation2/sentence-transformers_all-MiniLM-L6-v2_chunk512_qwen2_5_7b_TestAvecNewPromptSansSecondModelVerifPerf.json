However, in this case, since no proceedings are pending before the EPO, there is no consent required from Ms Smith as she has not been informed or involved in any opposition process. Therefore, the patent proprietor can request that Ms Smith be deleted as inventor.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The fact that no proceedings are pending does not prevent the deletion of an erroneously designated inventor under Rule 21(1) EPC if a formal request is made by the patent proprietor.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no need for Mr Li's consent to delete Ms Smith as an inventor because he has not been designated incorrectly and there are no pending proceedings. The correction can be made based on the patent proprietor’s sole request.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While Rule 21(1) EPC does state that a deletion must have the consent of the wrongly designated person, in this case, Ms Smith has not been notified or involved due to the lack of pending proceedings. Therefore, her consent is not required for the correction.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, C.2.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_2_2_5.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 1.2.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_1_2_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.3.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_3_7.html"

New representative Y needs to formally request a change of representative through the EPO's official channels (which involves filing the form for changing representatives). Additionally, Y needs to file a response to the extended European search report by the deadline (12 October 2023), which is within three months from the publication date. Furthermore, it is essential that an authorization signed by the applicant is filed in good time with the EPO to ensure that the change of representative is valid and recognized by the EPO.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:**  \n  While filing a response to the extended European search report by 12 October 2023 is correct, it does not address the necessary steps to formally appoint new representative Y. The applicant must also file an authorization signed by the applicant with the EPO to properly change the representation.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:**  \n  While filing a response to the extended European search report by 23 October 2023 at the latest and authorizing the change in good time would be correct, this date exceeds the required three-month period (90 days) from the publication date. The correct deadline for responding to the search report is 12 October 2023.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:**  \n  Similar to B, option D correctly mentions filing a response and an authorization but extends the deadline for the response by one day beyond the allowed period (12 October 2023 vs. 23 October 2023). This delay would result in the loss of rights for European patent application EP -A as it does not comply with EPC Article 123(3) which requires responses to be filed within a specific timeframe.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 151, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r151.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_2_2.html"

Re-establishment of rights,\" an applicant may apply to have their rights re-established if they were unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO despite taking all due care required by the circumstances. This includes missed deadlines such as filing the application within the priority period. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The Guidelines specify that requests for further processing must be made with payment of a prescribed fee and completion of an omitted act within two months. Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) requires filing a written request and paying the examination fee, which does not fall under re-establishment of rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The designation fee is typically paid after the application has been accepted by the EPO and is part of the regular fees required for maintaining the patent. It does not pertain to re-establishment of rights if a time limit was missed prior to this point.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The fee for re-establishment of rights is not an additional fee paid on top of existing obligations; rather, it refers to the process of regaining lost rights due to unmet deadlines. Thus, paying such a fee is part of the re-establishment procedure and does not independently represent a missed time limit that can be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

This aligns with standard procedural requirements that must be followed when acting on behalf of an applicant.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: There is no mandatory requirement in the PCT for the demand for international preliminary examination to be signed by either the applicant or their appointed representative; it can be submitted by any authorized person, such as Hassan. The demand only needs to be properly completed and filed with the designated offices.\n\n- **Why D is correct**: Article 18 of the PCT clearly states that an international application may be withdrawn by the applicant or anyone entitled under a power of attorney to represent them.

Since Spanish is an admissible non-EPO language under Art. 14(2) EPC 2000 and Spain is one of these countries, a Spanish European patent attorney can file a European patent application in Spanish for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and of Andorran nationality (provided that the applicant declares this entitlement by crossing the relevant box on Form 1001), thereby potentially being eligible for a reduced filing fee.\n\n- **Option B:** The German firm, with its principal place of business in Germany and an annual turnover of EUR 60 million, would not be entitled to a reduced fee as per Rule 6 EPC unless the natural person is resident in or a national of a country where Spanish is an admissible non-EPO language. Since the question does not specify such a condition for the Dutch national, B cannot be correct.\n\n- **Option C:** A natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality filing a European patent application in French would not qualify for a reduced fee as French is one of the official languages of the EPO. Hence, there is no basis to claim a reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option D:** A natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality filing a European patent application in Italian would not be eligible for a reduced fee because Italian is an admissible non-EPO language but Switzerland is one of the countries where the official languages are French, German, or English.

Typically, this would be the institution of a party's principal place of business (in this case, IMPI). \n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The Austrian Patent Office cannot act as the ISA for an application filed by a Mexican entity with its principal place of business in Tijuana, Mexico.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore can serve as an IPEA, it cannot act as the ISA for this particular application since Company M has already chosen to file with IMPI.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 17.2 PCT, which applies to claims for priority in international applications, a late claim for priority may be admitted within 16 months from the filing date of the earlier application (PCT-P) or within nine months after the actual filing of the later application if filed together with it. In this case, applicant P filed PCT-P on 20 June 2023, so the deadline to add EP-II as a priority is until 16 June 2024 (9 months from 7 July 2022). However, since the missing priority claim was discovered today (12 October 2023), P can still add it within 16 days after discovery, which aligns with the 16-month deadline. Therefore, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The proposed date (7 November 2023) would exceed the actual deadline of 3 November 2023 as calculated above.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The suggested date (20 October 2023) precedes the discovery date and does not align with the allowed period to add a late priority claim.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: This option incorrectly states that the time limit for adding the priority expired on 3 July 2023, which would be before the actual filing date (20 June 2023) of PCT-P.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

Since the period for filing comments has expired, they need to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect.

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct:** According to Rule 51(2) EPC and the guidelines provided, for renewal fees after the third year (i.e., the fourth and subsequent years), if payment is made before the publication of the grant, there is no additional fee. Since proceedings are being resumed today, the applicant has until the end of that patent year to pay without an additional fee. Therefore, as today is within the time frame of 30 April 2024 for paying renewal fees for the third and fourth years (assuming a normal 18-month timeline from filing), B is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The application is not deemed withdrawn simply because no renewal fee has been paid. It will resume as long as it can be brought back into force under Rule 142 EPC, which it can since proceedings are being resumed today.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The additional fee requirement does not change until after the third year (under Rule 51(2)). Since the fourth year's renewal fees fall within this period, there would be no need to pay an additional fee by 30 April 2024. Thus, paying with an additional fee later than necessary is incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While it might seem reasonable to think that October 12, 2023, is the latest date for payment since proceedings are being resumed today (assuming a typical patent year), the guidelines specify that third and fourth-year fees can be paid by the last day of those years. Therefore, the correct deadline, assuming no additional fee, would be 31 October 2023, not 31 October 2024 as stated in option D.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Since a request for early processing has been filed at 25 months after the filing date, the actions required are completing and filing Form 1200, paying the filing fee, and the search fee as per B-VI, 4.1.2 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The renewal fee for the third year (Rule 51) would typically not be due until at least one year after the request for early processing has been filed since it is related to the third year from the priority date or filing date. At this stage, only two years have passed.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: No representative needs to be appointed in this scenario as the actions mentioned (filling Form 1200 and paying fees) are sufficient for entry into the EP phase according to Rule 159(1). Appointment of a representative might be required later, but not at this stage.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Since Option A correctly identifies all necessary actions based on the given situation, it cannot be \"None of the above.\"\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, the examination fee (including designation fees) is refunded at a rate of 50% if the application is withdrawn after substantive examination has begun and before expiry of the (extended) time limit for replying to the first invitation under Rule 137(4). This time frame corresponds to six months from the date of mention in the European Patent Bulletin of the publication of the search report. Therefore, A is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not directly relate to the opportunity for a refund; it’s merely when the requirement for paying the designation fee becomes effective.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While the fees were paid within the required timeframe, they can still be refunded if the application is withdrawn before substantive examination has begun, as per the provisions in A-VI, 2.5 (which specify that there will be no refund only after certain communications indicating deficiencies).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The date of the start of substantive examination also does not correlate with the eligibility for a partial refund; it is the period within six months from the publication of the search report where the application can still qualify for such a refund according to the Guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

In this case, the execution date is 18 October 2024, which means the applicant can revoke the order to debit the renewal fee from their deposit account on 17 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The option \"10 October 2024\" does not align with the rule that allows revocation until one day before the execution date. Revoking it earlier than 17 October 2024 would mean that the partial revocation did not occur in time to prevent the fee from being debited.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The option \"18 October 2024\" is too late because according to the rules, the applicant must revoke the order by one day before the execution date. Therefore, 18 October 2024 is not a valid time for revoking the partial order.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The statement \"A debit order cannot be revoked in part\" is incorrect because the legal basis provided clearly states that revocation can occur until one day before the execution date, allowing for partial revocation.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html"

The guidelines state that \"Observations may be filed anonymously\" and further specify that they must be submitted in writing and in an official language of the EPO. This aligns with option D's statement.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Option A claims that the person filing third-party observations will be a party to the proceedings before the EPO, which is incorrect. The guidelines do not indicate that the filer of the observation becomes a party to the proceedings; they merely submit a comment or evidence that may influence the examination process.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B states that third-party observations must be filed in writing and cannot be submitted anonymously. While it's true that the observations must be filed in writing, option D already covers this by stating they \"must be filed in an official language of the EPO.\" Additionally, the guidelines explicitly allow for anonymous submissions.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Option C suggests that third-party observations are only considered if a statement of grounds is provided and an official fee is paid. However, the guidelines do not require any payment for filing observations; they state that \"Art. 115 Rule 114(1) Documentary evidence and, in particular, publications submitted in support of the arguments may be filed in any language.\" Moreover, third-party observations can still be considered even without a statement of grounds if they include relevant information or evidence (as mentioned in several guidelines). Therefore, this option is inaccurate based on the provided information.  \n\nIn conclusion, option D correctly summarizes one of the key aspects regarding the filing of third-party observations as per the provided legal documents.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

Therefore, you need to pay the additional search fees by 25 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: You are required to respond to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. Rule 64(1) requires that the European Patent Office informs the applicant about the requirement for paying an additional search fee, and you should consider this as part of your response strategy.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: According to EPC Rule 64(2), if you pay a fee under protest, you are not required to pay a separate protest fee. Thus, the statement that you must pay two protest fees within the time limit is incorrect.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If no additional search fees are paid within the specified time, the application does not automatically become withdrawn but will be treated as if it were abandoned or suspended, which may have different consequences depending on the specific rules and actions taken by the EPO.

Thus, submitting a DAS code (Digital Access Service) would not be relevant in this context.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Although filing an electronic certified copy directly with the EPO might seem convenient, there is no provision in the Guidelines for Examination that allows such action for national applications where the EPO is not the receiving office. The process requires interaction with the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While it may be possible to file a certified copy directly with the International Bureau, this option is not specified or supported by the Guidelines for Examination and would not align with the usual procedures established for national applications.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

This is because an appeal can only be filed against a decision that goes in favor of revoking the patent, not for maintaining it.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The statement \"At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided and firm B are entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision\" is incomplete. It does not specify whether the division decided to revoke or maintain the patent. Additionally, there is no indication that Firm A (the patent proprietor) withdrew their request for maintenance, which would be required for this scenario.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** According to EPC rules, only the patentee can file an appeal against a decision to maintain the patent as granted. In this case, Firm C filed observations and does not have standing to appeal the opposition division's decision regarding the maintenance of the patent.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** If Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings, it would not be entitled to file an appeal against a decision that maintains the patent as granted. Withdrawal of an opposition effectively means that Firm B no longer opposes the patent and cannot challenge the division's decision through an appeal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

As of 31 October 2024, it is in respect of the sixth year that the renewal fee must be paid.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The fifth year period has already ended as of 3 October 2024, and thus, no renewal fee for this period needs to be paid by 31 October 2024. \n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** Since the unitary effect was registered on 10 October 2024, it does not affect the calculation of the year in which the renewal fee is due. The registration date only indicates that unitary effect applies from this date onwards but does not alter the time limits for paying the renewal fees.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** As discussed above, no renewal fee has to be paid on 31 October 2024; it must be paid in respect of the sixth year (from 4 October 2024 to 3 October 2025).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

If actual notification occurred later than the tenth day, the period for which the deemed receipt of that document is the relevant event under Rule 131, paragraph 2, shall expire later by the number of days by which the seven days were exceeded. In this case, the communication was dated on 12 September 2024 and received nine days late on 21 September 2024, so it is deemed to be delivered on 22 September 2024. The four-month time limit starts from that date, which would end on 13 January 2025.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: 12 January 2025 does not account for the late delivery by nine days.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: 22 January 2025 incorrectly adds an extra day to the correct period end date.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: 14 January 2025 overestimates the time limit and does not reflect the late delivery.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

While the service can be used when there are technical issues on the user's end, it is not recommended for such situations; instead, the user should seek support or use another method to resolve the issue.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The EPO Contingency Upload Service is not specifically designed for submission after business hours but rather as a contingency measure when standard systems are down.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct: According to the guidelines and case law provided, if an applicant files a European patent application in a language other than one of the official languages of the EPO (such as Finnish), they can provide amended claims in that same language. In this instance, Korhonen has filed his original application in Finnish and subsequently provides an English translation. He is therefore allowed to file amended claims in Finnish provided he also submits a timely translation into any official language of the EPO within the required timeframe.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While option B mentions filing amendments in Finnish and providing translations, it does not specify that the translation must be submitted in time. The requirement for submitting the translation in time (as mentioned under Rule 71(3) of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO) is crucial.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: Option A incorrectly requires Korhonen to file both the amended claims and their translations in English, which is not necessary if he initially filed his application in Finnish. He can submit the amendments in the same language as the original filing but must provide a translation in time into any official EPO language.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Option D wrongly states that Korhonen is not allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish at all, which contradicts the rules allowing for applications and subsequent amendments in languages other than the official ones if translations are provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

However, if the priority application is a Belgian application (not an EPO application) in French, then PCT Direct would not be directly applicable because it specifically refers to international applications filed with the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The priority application being an EP application does not preclude the availability of PCT Direct. It only specifies that the language and system used are English and Online Filing 2.0, which complies with the requirements for PCT Direct.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: An international application filed with the EPO in English already meets the language requirement for PCT Direct. Therefore, using Online Filing 2.0 to file a subsequent international application in English also satisfies the conditions for PCT Direct.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it is common practice to include amended claims in the PCT Direct letter, this is not an absolute requirement for PCT Direct availability. The primary condition is that the language and filing system are compatible with the EPO’s requirements.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

Dutch is one of these languages since it is recognized by the European Union. Therefore, Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The requirement specifies that the translation should be in an official language of the European Union, not any of the 18 states or any state that has signed the UPCA ( Unified Patent Court Agreement). \n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While Spain and its language are part of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA, the requirement for unitary effect is specifically in an official language of the European Union. Since Dutch is an EU official language, it meets this criterion.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Spanish is not mentioned as one of the official languages of the European Union required for translations under Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 and the Unitary Patent Guide.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
