In this case, since Mr. Li and Ms. Smith were erroneously designated as co-inventors and it has been found out that only Mr. Li was actually involved in the invention, a request can be made to rectify the designation.\\n\\nAnswer B is incorrect because the patent proprietor (Mr. Li’s company) still retains the right to make corrections even if no proceedings are pending before the EPO according to Rule 21(1).\\n\\nWhy options C and D are incorrect:\\n- Option C incorrectly states that Mr. Li's consent would be necessary for deleting Ms. Smith as an inventor, which is not required when adding a further inventor.\\n- Option D is also incorrect because it suggests that only Ms. Smith’s consent can delete her from the list of inventors, whereas according to the guidelines, consent from both parties (the wrongly designated person and the patent's applicant or proprietor) is needed.\\n\\nIn summary, since the designation was incorrect, Mr. Li's company as the patent proprietor has the authority to correct it by requesting that Ms. Smith be deleted, but this request needs to include the consent of the wrongly designated person (Ms. Smith).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_5.html"

According to Rule 13(4)(b) of the Rules of Procedure of the EPO (RPE), when a response must be filed with the EPO by 12 October 2023, and there is no extension, it should not extend beyond that date.

Given that the patent is being validated in only two states, renewal fees for those states can be paid separately. The due date to pay the fourth year's fee (which would have been 16 November 2024) has not yet arrived as of 12 October 2023. Therefore, based on Article 98(1)(a), the renewal fee for the fourth year can be validly paid without any additional fee until nine months after the end of the third year (i.e., from 17 November 2024) but at the latest one month from the date on which validation took place, meaning by 16 December 2023.\n\nHowever, since the due date for the fourth-year fee is still two years away as of now (12 October 2023), and validation occurred in November 2023, the renewal fee can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest.\n\nOption A suggests paying centrally to the EPO, which is incorrect for validating only two states.\nOption B suggests a due date of 30 November 2023, which is too early and does not align with Article 98(1)(a).\nOption D incorrectly suggests a later date (16 January 2024) than what is allowed by the EPC regulations.\n\nThus, only option C correctly reflects both the payment of fees separately in each state and the latest due date for paying the fourth-year fee without additional costs.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the guidelines from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (E-IX, 1), the applicant can choose the European Patent Office (EPO) as an International Searching Authority (ISA) and either the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the EPO itself as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA).\n\nWhy B is correct:\n- Option B states 'The applicant can choose the USPTO as ISA and the EPO as IPEA.' This aligns with the rules mentioned in the text, which allow for the EPO to act both as an ISA and as an elected Office or IPEA. The applicant has flexibility in choosing between offices from different countries.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: 'The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA.' This is correct, but the question asks for a single statement that is true, implying one of these combinations might be preferred or more common. However, since option B is already correct, it makes sense to select this over A.\n- Option C: 'The applicant can choose the Austrian Patent Office as ISA and the EPO as IPEA.' This would only work if the application was filed at an office where Austria has a designated status. Since the application was filed in Mexico, there is no indication that Austria is a relevant Office for this case.\n- Option D: 'The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore as IPEA.' According to the text, only specific Offices such as those from countries like Austria, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Turkey, the Austrian, Spanish, Swedish, Finnish or Turkish Patent Office, the Nordic Patent Institute or the Visegrad Patent Institute can serve as an IPEA if the international search was carried out by a different office. The IPOS (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore) is not listed in this context and thus cannot be chosen under these rules.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the provided legal text, B correctly represents the available choices for ISA and IPEA roles according to the PCT procedures when filing an application with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Rule 19(4), the time limit for adding a priority claim is twelve months from the filing date of the European patent application. In this case, applicant P filed the international patent application (PCT-P) on June 20, 2023, which is more than one year after the filing dates of both EP-I and EP-II (7 July 2022 and 3 July 2022 respectively). However, since the priority claim from EP-II was not originally made, we must consider the date when applicant P discovered this omission. The time limit for adding a missing claim to a European patent application is deemed to expire on the last day of the month in which the document containing the information about that claim or right has been filed.\\n\\nIn this scenario, the latest priority claim (EP-II) was not claimed until 12 October 2023. Thus, according to Rule 58(6), the time limit for adding EP-II as a priority claim would expire on the last day of the month following its discovery date. Since it is now October, the time limit will expire on November 30, 2023. Therefore, if applicant P files a request to add EP-II as a priority claim by or before November 30, 2023, the addition would be valid.\\n\\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A (Yes, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 3 November 2023)**: This is incorrect because it suggests the deadline should match one of EP-II's filing dates. According to Rule 58(6), the exact date of the discovery (12 October 2023) dictates the end of the twelve-month period, making November 30, 2023, the correct deadline.\\n- **Option C (Yes, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 20 October 2023)**: This is incorrect because it suggests the deadline was based on the filing date of PCT-P rather than when applicant P discovered the missing claim.\\n- **Option D (No, the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023)**: This is incorrect as it incorrectly assumes that the time limit started from EP-II's filing date and has already passed. The discovery of the omission on October 12, 2023, resets the twelve-month period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html"

The opponent/respondent has filed their comments within the given four-month period by 12 October 2023, which falls within the deadline set out.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: There was no need for an extension since the comment was timely submitted.\n- Option B: No fee is mentioned or required as part of the procedural steps described in the communication from the board.\n- Option C: The situation does not require a request for reestablishment of rights, as there were no indications that any procedural rights had lapsed. The opponent/respondent simply filed comments within the given time frame.\n\nThus, none of these options (A, B, or C) are necessary actions in this specific scenario based on the provided legal context and communication from the board of appeal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal text and guidelines for examination in the EPO (A-X, 5.2.4), renewal fees can be validly paid without any additional fee by the due date specified under Rule 51(1). In this scenario, since the application was filed on March 20, 2020, the third-year renewal fee would fall due in November of that same year (30.11.2020), and the fourth-year renewal fee would be due a year later by October 31, 2021.\n\nHowever, since proceedings were interrupted under Rule 142 EPC on March 10, 2022, the applicant was not required to pay any renewal fees during this period. Now that proceedings have resumed on October 12, 2023, the applicant must catch up with the renewal fees that were due while the application was interrupted.\n\nThe earliest valid dates for payment of these renewed third and fourth-year fees can be calculated as follows:\n- The third year's renewal fee would now fall due in November 2023 (30.11.2023).\n- The fourth year's renewal fee would fall due in November 2024 (30.11.2024).\n\nOption B is correct because the renewal fees for both the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by their respective due dates, which are October 31, 2023, and October 31, 2024.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- Option A: The application is not deemed to be withdrawn simply because no renewal fees have been paid. According to Rule 51(1) of the EPC, the applicant still has a grace period after the due date to validly pay the renewal fee.\n- Option C: The additional fee can only be paid until the end of the sixth month following the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing (Rule 51(2), J 4/91, reasons 2.7). This would place the deadline for payment of the additional fee by April 30, 2024, which is later than the due dates mentioned in Option B.\n- Option D: The renewal fees can be paid without any additional fee up to their respective due dates (November 30, 2023, and November 30, 2024). Thus, stating they must be paid by October 31, 2023, is incorrect as it does not leave enough time to pay for the third year's renewal fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

The application must be completed and filed according to Form 1200, which is used for requests for entry into the European phase of international applications. Additionally, payment of fees should include the filing fee as well as the search fee.\n\nOption A is correct because it matches these requirements: completing and filing Form 1200 and paying the filing fee and the search fee.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option B (paying the renewal fee for the third year) is incorrect. The renewal fees are not due until the application has been entered into the European phase, which occurs when the applicant completes and files Form 1200. Since this process has not yet taken place as of the point in time described in the question, paying the renewal fee early would be premature.\n\n- Option C (appointing a representative) is not mentioned as necessary in the context provided by B-XI, 8 for entry into the European phase where there are no objections to the search opinion and no priority claims. While it might be advisable to appoint a representative later on during the examination process, this action is not required upon entry according to the given text.\n\n- Option D (None of the above statements) would only be correct if none of A, B or C were accurate, which they are in this scenario as option A fits the requirements.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_8.html"

If this fee is not paid within that basic period, the European patent application (see Article 153(2)) is deemed withdrawn. Option A is incorrect because there's no specific six-month period mentioned in the guidelines for withdrawing an application to obtain a refund of the designation fee. The relevant deadline here is 31 months from the filing date, not six months after the publication of the European search report (which is unrelated to this specific context). Option B is also incorrect as it refers to 'the date of mention of the publication of the European search report,' which again has no direct relation to the timing for withdrawing an application due to a late designation fee payment. Option D is incorrect because the start of substantive examination, while a significant milestone in the patent process, does not affect the 31-month period within which the designation fee must be paid. If the fee is validly paid and still withdrawn beyond this period, it cannot be refunded.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

In this case, if the renewal fee was not due on October 10th and an amendment to the debit order is required, the correct procedure would involve revoking the entire order or submitting a new one. Therefore, the earliest point for such actions would be after 18 October 2024 when the original order becomes effective.\n\n- **Option A (10 October 2024):** Incorrect as the debit order is not yet executed and cannot be modified at this time.\n- **Option C (18 October 2024):** This is too late. By this date, the renewal fee would already have been debited from the deposit account according to the original order.\n- **Option D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part):** While this statement is true under the circumstances described, it does not provide the latest point for action as it implies that no changes can be made at all.\n\nIn conclusion, since CFP allows revocation only after execution and here there was a mistake before execution could take place on 18 October 2024, the earliest opportunity to correct this error would logically be after the order is executed. Thus, option B (17 October 2024) represents the latest possible date within the day of execution not yet occurring, which aligns with the process described in A-X, 6.1 where actions must occur before execution or through subsequent communication and correction procedures.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

Since October 10, 2024, is more than four months after the decision was issued, the applicant can still do so. This means filing an appeal is possible and correct.\\n\\n2. **Option B - File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision:**\\n   According to Art. 135(2) EPC, a request for further processing will not be granted if there has been a failure to comply with Rule 60(2). This rule states that where a designation of an inventor is required and not filed within the time limit set by the Receiving Section under Rule 60(1), no communication shall issue to the applicant. Since this situation applies here, further processing cannot be requested after missing the time limit.\\n\\n3. **Option C - File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor:**\\n   According to Art. 122(1) EPC, an applicant may file a request for re-establishment of rights if he or she failed to meet a procedural requirement due to circumstances beyond his control and within two months from receipt of notification that the requirement was not met (Rule 136). This is a remedy available to the applicant.\\n\\n4. **Option D - A, B and C are correct:**\\n   As explained above, only options A and C are applicable under the provided context. Therefore, this option is incorrect because it includes B which cannot be done as per EPC rules.\\n\\n**Why other options (B) and (D) are incorrect:**\n- **Option B:** This is not available since Rule 135(2) explicitly states that further processing for failure to observe the time limit under Rule 60(1) will not be granted.\\n- **Option D:** Since Option B is incorrect, option D cannot be correct.\\n\\nThus, the correct answer is A and C.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

These observations may include a statement of the grounds on which they are based and an official fee is paid. The EPO will consider these observations when deciding whether to grant the patent.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nA: While it's true that third-party observations can be filed by any person (see D-I, 6), these persons do not become parties to the proceedings before the EPO. They only have a right to present their views on the grounds of opposition and are not obliged to respond to these observations.\n\nB: The text does not explicitly state that third-party observations must be made in writing or cannot be filed anonymously. However, as per standard practice and the guidelines, it is expected for such communications to be made in writing. Furthermore, there's no explicit rule against filing them anonymously either; however, it can complicate matters if the EPO needs clarification.\n\nC: The text mentions that third-party observations are considered by the examining division only if they include a statement of the grounds on which they are based and an official fee is paid (see D-I, 6). However, this option incorrectly states that these conditions must be met for them to be considered at all. They can still have some influence even without a complete statement of grounds or payment of the fee.\n\nOption D correctly identifies that third-party observations can be filed after the publication of a European patent application and should be in an official language of the EPO, as per the legal context provided by the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html"

The applicant must pay additional search fees within two months from the receipt of the communication to proceed with the partial search. In this case, you have received a communication dated 25 September 2024 from the EPO acting as ISA, stating that unity of invention has not been complied with and identifying three inventions. You are invited to pay two additional search fees. According to Rule 164(1), you must pay these additional search fees within two months (i.e., by 25 November 2024) if you wish the ISA to carry out a partial search on all identified inventions. Why other options are incorrect:\n\n- B: You do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results.\n   - According to the Guidelines, although it is recommended that applicants provide a written response, this is not strictly required for the payment of additional search fees. However, paying the fees without any clarification or response might not be in your best interest as it could lead to delays.\n\n- C: If you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must pay two protest fees within the time limit.\n   - There is no provision in the Guidelines for Examination stating that protest fees are required if an applicant pays search fees under protest. This option introduces a concept not found in the provided text and is therefore incorrect.\n\n- D: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn.\n   - While it's true that failing to pay the additional search fees might result in consequences, this does not automatically mean the application will be withdrawn. According to Rule 164(2), if a request for a partial European search has been made and the required search fee is not paid by the deadline, the ISA shall inform the applicant accordingly but will still carry out a full search on the first invention or unitary group of inventions mentioned in the claims unless it has already issued an opinion that these are not patentable.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html"

If no certified copy is filed at the time of filing the international application, it can be submitted subsequently. Option A, which involves requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO, complies with R. 81(2), as this process ensures that the EPO receives an authentic and legally acceptable copy of the prior application. This is the correct action to take in the given scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the legal text and case law provided, Firm B has the right to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision if the decision is to revoke the patent. This aligns with option A where 'At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to revoke the patent. Firm B is entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision.' Option B is incorrect because it repeats part of statement A and adds an unnecessary comma which does not add any new information relevant for the legal context. Option C is incorrect based on the provided text because it states that Firm C, who only filed observations (not a formal opposition), would have the right to appeal if the patent was maintained. According to Art. 102(4) and (5) EPC 1973, revocation of a patent must be based on an opposition or an application for declaration of invalidity. Observations do not constitute such grounds and thus Firm C would not have the right to appeal in this case. Option D is incorrect because it states that Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings and then appeals the decision to maintain the patent, which contradicts the procedural rules. According to EPC 1973, once an opposition has been withdrawn or abandoned, there can be no further grounds for appeal from such a decision. Therefore, based on the legal text provided, only option A accurately reflects the correct situation and applicable rights under these circumstances.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.8.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_8_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_1.html"

For a European patent application EP -X-C0 with unitary effect registered on 10 October 2024, the proprietor needs to pay the renewal fee at the end of the fifth year after the filing date. Since the application was filed claiming priority from 16 October 2019 (which is also the filing date for EP -X-C0 due to unitary effect), the fifth year would be up by 31 October 2024.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A is incorrect because it refers to the 5th year, which is correct but incorrectly states that a fee needs to be paid as of 31 October 2024. The text does not specify this date for paying fees.\n- Option C is incorrect as it refers to the 6th year, which is one year too late according to the Guidelines.\n- Option D is incorrect because there is no provision in the Guidelines stating that a renewal fee is waived after unitary effect registration.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and legal text, option B (A renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year for EP -X-C0) is the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

The mailbox and filing via eFAS are correctly identified but miss out on the shared area with examiners which is part of the MyEPO portfolio.\n\nOption A contains an inaccurate reference to a 'shared area with examiners' that isn't explicitly detailed in the provided legal text related to MyEPO access functionalities, thus making it incorrect. The correct answer focuses solely on services directly stated as accessible from the MyEPO Portfolio: filing via Online Filing 2.0, patent search via publication server, and Mailbox.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D, which aligns with the functionalities provided by the EPO in their guidelines for user access to MyEPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-I, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_i_1.html"

This implies that during such an outage, applicants can use this service as a backup method to submit their documents.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A (When you submit documents after business hours)**: The Guidelines do not specifically mention using the contingency upload for submitting documents outside of regular business hours. Therefore, this is not the recommended scenario according to the text provided.\\n\\n- **Option B (When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly but you encounter a technical issue at your end)**: The document does not suggest that the contingency service should be used when there's only a client-side technical problem with no system outage at the EPO.

The guidelines further specify that translations into English are often required for such documents to be accepted, and this aligns with option C.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\nB: While it is technically possible under some circumstances to file amendments or requests in non-EPO languages if certain conditions (such as being a national of an EPC contracting state) are met, the provision explicitly requires that translations into admissible non-EPO languages be filed simultaneously with these documents. The phrase 'in time' suggests this process must occur within the given time limits and not after.\n\nD: This option is incorrect because there is no restriction in the guidelines against filing amendments or requests in a language other than English, French, or German as long as the necessary translation is provided in an admissible non-EPO language.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html"

This scenario satisfies all three conditions mentioned above; hence, it is correct according to Article 6. However, since the question asks for an incorrect statement among the given options, we need to identify why Options A, C, and D are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: 'PCT Direct is available if the priority application is a Belgian application filed in French, which has been searched and the international application is filed in French, using ePCT -Filing.' This scenario is incorrect because PCT Direct is only available for applications that have been filed with the EPO. A Belgian application (filed at the Belgian Patent Office) does not meet this requirement.\n\n- Option C: 'PCT Direct is available if the priority application is an international application filed with the EPO in English, which has been searched by the EPO and the subsequent international application is filed in English, using Online Filing 2.0.' This scenario is also incorrect because a priority application cannot be an international application itself; it must have originated from a national or regional application.\n\n- Option D: 'PCT Direct is available on condition that amended claims are filed with the PCT Direct letter, in a single PDF document.' While this statement might be true for some scenarios, it does not contradict any specific rule of Article 6. However, Option B explicitly meets all criteria required by PCT Direct and hence is not incorrect.\n\nTherefore, none of A, C, or D are correct according to Article 6, making Option B the correct choice in identifying an incorrect statement among the given options.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html"

This means that Mr Linguist needs to provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the states that are members of the European Patent Office (EPO).\n\nOption B is correct because it specifies that Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends. Since the EPO has 39 member states as of now, but only 18 are required for the unitary effect under Article 75(2) of the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA), this is the correct choice.\n\n**Explanation why other options are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option A:** Requires translation into Dutch. While Mr Linguist filed in Dutch, he must provide a translation in an official language of any state that extends the unitary effect, not necessarily in Dutch.\n  \n- **Option C:** Specifies that a translation should be provided in Spanish or another official language of 24 signatory states to the UPCA. However, the requirement is for one of the 18 states that extend the unitary effect, which does not necessarily include all 24 signatories.\n\n- **Option D:** Suggests providing a translation into Spanish. This is incorrect because there is no specific requirement to translate into any particular language beyond those of the states extending the unitary effect (18 in this case).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"
