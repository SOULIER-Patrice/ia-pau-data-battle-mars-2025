According to R. 21(1) EPC, a patent proprietor may request that an incorrect designation of inventor be rectified upon request and only with the consent of the wrongly designated person. However, if such a request is filed by a third party, the consent of the applicant for or proprietor of the European patent is required. In this case, since no proceedings are pending and Ms Smith was erroneously designated as an inventor, the patent proprietor can request that she be deleted without her explicit consent.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The fact that no opposition has been filed does not preclude the patent proprietor from making corrections to the patent application information according to R. 21(1) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While it may seem logical that the patent proprietor would need Mr Li’s consent, there is no legal requirement in the EPC for the consent of a listed inventor (in this case, Mr Li) when an erroneous designation exists and the correction does not involve active proceedings or disputes over rights.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The regulation allows for deletion of an erroneously designated inventor without her explicit consent if the patent proprietor requests it, as per R. 21(1) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, C.2.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_2_2_5.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 1.2.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_1_2_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, A.3.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_3_7.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:**\n  According to the guidelines provided, when an applicant wishes to replace a representative, they must request a change of representative and file this with the EPO. Additionally, for the new representative Y to effectively represent the application in response to any communications from the EPO (such as the extended European search report), they must also provide an authorisation signed by the applicant. Since the deadline for responding to the extended European search report is 12 October 2023, this needs to be done by that date at the latest. Therefore, option A correctly addresses both steps: requesting a change of representative and filing the response on time, as well as obtaining an authorisation signed by the applicant.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:**\n  Option B omits the requirement for Y to file an authorisation signed by the applicant with the EPO. Without this document, Y would not be legally authorised to act on behalf of the applicant and could lead to a loss of rights or other legal complications. Therefore, B does not fully satisfy the requirements.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:**\n  Option C incorrectly sets the deadline for responding to the extended European search report as 23 October 2023, which is one day after the actual deadline of 12 October 2023. This could result in a loss of rights or delays in the examination process.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:**\n  Option D also sets an incorrect response deadline of 23 October 2023 and repeats the requirement to file an authorisation signed by the applicant, which should be done without specifying when. Therefore, it is redundant and introduces an error regarding the deadline for responding to the extended European search report.\n\nThus, option A correctly covers all necessary steps to validly appoint representative Y while avoiding any loss of rights for European patent application EP -A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 151, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r151.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **C is correct**: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if an applicant fails to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO despite taking all due care required by the circumstances, they may apply to have their rights re-established. The context provided specifically mentions that this can be applied to situations where a missed time limit cannot be remedied through other means such as further processing or paying additional fees. Thus, the correct answer is C: the time limit for filing the application within the priority period.\n\n- **A (Time limit for paying the designation fee) is incorrect**: The context does not mention any specific procedure to re-establish rights in relation to the designation fee payment; it refers instead to further processing or requests for examination. Payment of the designation fees is a standard procedural requirement and not covered under Article 122.\n\n- **B (Time limit for requesting examination) is incorrect**: The guidelines discuss further processing options if the time limit for requesting examination has been missed, which involves paying additional fees and does not require re-establishment of rights. This means that missing this time limit can be addressed through further processing rather than re-establishment of rights.\n\n- **D (Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights) is incorrect**: The context provided does not indicate any specific fee associated with requesting re-establishment of rights. Re-establishment of rights is a procedure available when no other means to remedy the missed time limit are applicable, and it involves filing an application rather than payment of fees.\n\nIn conclusion, missing the time limit for filing the application within the priority period can be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights under Article 122. The other options do not fit this context as they either have their own specified procedures (like further processing) or are not related to the re-establishment of rights procedure described in the guidelines. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

The declaration of entitlement must be made by crossing the relevant box on Form 1001.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: A firm's size (principal place of business in Germany, employing 200 people and having an annual turnover of EUR 60 million) and the nationality of a natural person resident in Germany do not qualify for the fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC. The rule pertains to natural persons with specific nationalities or from countries that have concluded such agreements.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: A natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality does not automatically qualify for a filing fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC, as the nationality alone (Belgian) does not meet the criteria for reduced fees. Additionally, they filed in French, which may or may not be eligible based on other agreements but is not specified here.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to option C, a natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality would need to have their country (Switzerland) having concluded an agreement with the EPO for the filing fee reduction.

The noting of loss of rights issued by the Receiving Section confirms this.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because Mr Van Holland has already passed the two-month deadline for filing a translation, as stated in Rule 58 EPC and 57(a) EPC. There is no provision allowing for remediation beyond the specified timeframe once an application is deemed withdrawn due to non-compliance with language requirements.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because while further processing may be requested after loss of rights, it is not a remedy for the deficiency in this case where the application has already been deemed withdrawn. The filing of an English translation alone without re-establishment procedures would not suffice given the automatic withdrawal upon non-compliance.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because Mr Van Holland cannot apply for re-establishment of rights after loss of rights due to non-payment or non-filing within the prescribed deadlines, especially in this scenario where the language deficiency was a reason for the application's deemed withdrawal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

The context does not specify any restrictions on these choices. \n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement that the applicant can choose the USPTO as ISA and the EPO as IPEA is not correct, as the roles of ISA and IPEA are specific to the respective institutions.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While it might be possible for Company M to choose the Austrian Patent Office (APO) as the ISA, the context does not provide any information that would support this choice over the EPO. Additionally, there is no explicit mention or implication that APO should be chosen as the IPEA.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) cannot be selected as either the ISA or IPEA based on the given context and standard patent procedures for PCT applications.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

According to Article 19(2) of the PCT, a claim for priority can be added within 12 months from the filing date of the first-filed application (in this case, EP-I filed on 7 July 2022). Since today is 12 October 2023, and 12 months from 7 July 2022 would expire on 6 July 2023, but the actual deadline for claiming priority is extended to November. The deadline for adding EP-II as a priority application in PCT-P is until 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The correct deadline is 3 November 2023, not 7 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While today is 12 October 2023, the time limit for adding EP-II as a priority application to PCT-P does not expire on this day but extends until 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

In this case, the opponent/respondent was given four months from 1 June 2023 to file comments. The current date is 12 October 2023, which means that the time limit for filing comments has expired without an extension being requested or granted. Therefore, the opponent/ respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no indication in EPC Rule 100 or other relevant rules that a fee needs to be paid merely because the deadline was missed and not due to specific circumstances such as financial hardship or similar reasons. The rule focuses on the timely filing of observations, which has not been done without an extension.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no mention in EPC Rule 100 or relevant case law that reestablishment of rights needs to be requested and a fee paid for comments that were due but not filed within the time limit. The issue here is timely filing, not loss or waiver of any rights.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since option A (requesting an extension) addresses the situation at hand, none of the other options provided would be correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

Since the application was filed on 20 March 2020, the third patent year begins on 21 March 2021 and ends on 20 March 2022.

Given that today is 12 October 2023, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be paid without any additional fee by 30 April 2024 (one month after the end of the fourth year), which aligns with option B.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The application has not been deemed withdrawn because proceedings have been resumed.  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While an additional fee can be paid, it would need to be by 30 April 2024 at the latest, and thus paying until 30 April 2024 does not meet the \"at the latest\" requirement on or before 12 October 2023.  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The renewal fees can only be paid without an additional fee by 30 April 2024, as per Rule 51(2), and thus paying until 31 October 2023 would not comply with the latest allowable time for payment in this scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

The renewal fee for the third year would not be due as of 25 months after the filing date, nor is appointing a representative required at this stage.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect**: There is no mention in the scenario that the period under Rule 70 has expired earlier or that the application has reached its third year such that the renewal fee for the third year needs to be paid. \n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: While it might be necessary to appoint a representative at some point, this is not required specifically within the first 25 months after filing under normal circumstances unless there are specific reasons stated in the scenario.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: Option A does reflect all actions needed based on the information provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

These communications include, among others, summonses to oral proceedings under Rule 115(1). Therefore, the latest point in time for withdrawing the application is six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not allow for a refund; it only marks the start of the time period during which an applicant can request further processing if necessary (Art. 121 EPC).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While the designation fee was validly paid, this does not prevent the application from being withdrawn or the examination process from continuing as long as the requirements are met.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

Furthermore, these observations must be made in writing (Rule 114(1)), and they may not be submitted anonymously (Option B is incorrect). The observations do not require an official fee to be filed, making Option C incorrect as well. Lastly, it is clearly stated that third-party observations are considered by the examining division only if they include a statement of the grounds on which they are based. Thus, D correctly summarizes the requirements for filing such observations.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: As mentioned earlier, while third-party observations can be filed in writing and must comply with Rule 114(1), there is no prohibition against submitting them anonymously (Option C addresses this, but incorrectly states that an official fee is required). Therefore, stating that third-party observations \"may not be filed anonymously\" is inaccurate.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: The statement in Option A claims that the person filing the third-party observations will become a party to the proceedings and that the applicant must respond. However, neither the EPO Guidelines nor any other provided section indicates this; rather, the applicant may respond (as noted in Option D).\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: While it is true that documents supporting arguments should be filed in an official language or a translation provided within a period as specified by the EPO (Option B addresses this but incorrectly claims the observations cannot be anonymous), there is no mention in the guidelines that filing third-party observations requires payment. Option C inaccurately combines these requirements, making it incorrect. \n\nIn conclusion, D correctly summarizes the conditions for filing third-party observations without including inaccurate statements found in Options A, B, and C.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

In this case, since you received the communication on 25 September 2024, you need to pay any required fees by 25 November 2024 (two months later). Therefore, paying the additional search fees by 25 October 2024 is incorrect.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: According to EPC Rule 64(1), the ISA will provide a provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. The applicant must respond to this provisional opinion if they wish to amend their application, which may include paying additional fees for further searches or modifying the claims and description.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: If you pay any fee under protest, EPC Rule 64(2) states that the fee paid under paragraph 1 will be refunded if, during the examination of the European patent application, the Examining Division finds that the communication under paragraph 1 was not justified. Therefore, paying a protest fee is unnecessary.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: EPC Rule 64(1) does not state that an international patent application will be deemed withdrawn if additional search fees are not paid within the time limit. Instead, it indicates that the search report would only cover the inventions for which the required fees have been paid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

In this case, since no certified copy was filed at the time of filing the international patent application on September 10, 2024, it is necessary to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LPIO) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application filed on October 11, 2023. The LPIO is the appropriate authority for preparing and sending such documents in this scenario.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) can facilitate obtaining electronic copies of documents from the International Bureau, it does not address the need to obtain a certified copy specifically from the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office. The EPO Guidelines do not provide for the International Bureau to directly issue certified copies on behalf of national or regional patent offices.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Filing an electronic certified copy with the EPO would only be applicable if there were no need to request a certified copy, such as when the previous application was filed electronically. Since in this case, the Luxembourg patent application was likely filed through conventional means and requires a certified hard-copy, submitting an electronic version directly to the EPO is not appropriate.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The International Bureau does not handle requests for certified copies from national or regional patent offices. It primarily deals with PCT applications and documents related to international filings. Thus, filing a certified copy with the International Bureau would be inappropriate in this context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-XI, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_xi_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

This is because the decision to revoke the patent is adverse to Firm B's position as the owner of the patent.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement \"and firm B are entitled\" at the end makes it grammatically incomplete and does not clarify Firm A or C's rights, which are irrelevant in this context since Firm B has already withdrawn its opposition. \n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Firm C filed observations under Article 115 EPC but did not initiate an opposition or support an opposition from a third party. Therefore, Firm C does not have standing to appeal the decision.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings, it still retains the right to appeal the decision as long as the opposition division decides to revoke the patent at the end of the proceedings. The withdrawal only affects their participation in the ongoing process but does not preclude them from appealing an adverse decision.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_4_1.html"

Therefore, the 5th year's renewal fee should be paid by October 31, 2024, for EP -X.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The publication date of grant on October 2, 2024, does not impact the start or due date of the renewal fees. As the 5th year's fee was due on October 31, 2024, there is no need to pay for the 6th year.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since unitary effect has been registered and the proprietor will still be liable for paying the renewal fee for the ongoing validity period of the patent, a non-payment would result in penalties or loss of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

In this case, the communication dated 12 September 2024 was received on 21 September 2024, which is nine days later. Therefore, the time limit would be extended by two days (since \\(9 - 7 = 2\\)). The four-month period starting from 12 September 2024 plus these two additional days results in a deadline of 13 January 2025.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The date 12 January 2025 does not account for the late delivery as it only adds seven days to the original due date, ignoring the extra time required by Rule 126(2) EPC.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The date 22 January 2025 incorrectly assumes that the period should be extended by more than just the two extra days calculated under Rule 126(2) EPC, which leads to an unnecessary and incorrect extension.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The date 14 January 2025 also does not correctly account for the late delivery as it only adds one day beyond the seven-day grace period, leading to an incorrect deadline.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

This service is intended as an alternative during such disruptions.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The service is not recommended for situations where the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly but you encounter a technical issue at your end, because there are other means available (such as MyEPO Portfolio) that can handle such issues without resorting to contingency services.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: Using the EPO Contingency Upload Service for submitting documents after business hours is not specifically recommended. The service is more relevant in cases where system outages occur, affecting document submissions during operating hours.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If the EPO is closed due to an official holiday, it would be outside of normal operation and therefore not a suitable scenario for using any filing services provided by the EPO, including the Contingency Upload Service.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch because the application was originally filed in that language, and according to Article 70(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), if the European patent application has been filed in a language which is not an official language of the EPO, then that text shall be the application as filed within the meaning of this Convention. Therefore, Mr Linguist must provide a translation into Dutch.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The language of the application must match the filing language if no other situation applies; hence providing a translation in an official language not necessarily linked to the extent of unitary effect (18 states) is unnecessary and incorrect based on the information given.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While C suggests providing a translation into an official language of any state that has signed the UPCA, this is broader than necessary since the application can be in the original filing language as per Article 70(2) EPC. The requirement pertains to aligning with the original filing language, which is Dutch.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Providing a translation into Spanish would not be required because the original application was filed in Dutch and no other situation necessitates an additional translation (like using non-EPO languages or divisional applications).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
