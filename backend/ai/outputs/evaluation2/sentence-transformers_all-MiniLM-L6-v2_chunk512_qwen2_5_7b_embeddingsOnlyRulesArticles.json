                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:** According to EPC Rule 20(1), the designated inventor shall be mentioned unless he informs the European Patent Office in writing that he has waived his right to be thus mentioned. In this scenario, Mr Li and Ms Smith were initially designated as inventors, but upon notification by the patent proprietor on October 12, 2023, it was found that Ms Smith was erroneously designated. The rule allows for the deletion of a listed inventor if they have not waived their right to be mentioned. Since there are no opposing parties and no pending proceedings (as stated in option B), the patent proprietor can request the deletion of Ms Smith's name as an inventor through formal notification to the European Patent Office, thus making statement A correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While it is true that no opposition was filed at the time of the error discovery, there are still procedures for correcting errors in the patent application. EPC Rule 20 provides a process for removing an inventor if they have not waived their right to be mentioned and if such removal does not affect any pending proceedings.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** EPC Rule 20(1) specifically states that the designated inventor may waive his or her right to be listed, but it does not require consent from other named inventors (like Mr Li in this case). Therefore, statement C, which suggests that Mr Li’s consent is needed, is incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While EPC Rule 20 allows the patent proprietor to request deletion without Ms Smith's consent if she has not waived her right, it does not state that consent from the inventor herself is required. Therefore, statement D is an overstatement and inaccurate according to the rule. \n\nIn conclusion, A is the correct answer as per EPC Rule 20(1) and (2).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: EPC Rule 78, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r78.html\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Article 99, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a99.html\nSource: EPC Rule 20, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r20.html"

Since Y is now the new representative, Y should make this request.\n- Under EPC Article 84(5) and Rule 36(3), a response to an extended European search report must be filed within four months from the publication date of the search report. The extended European search report was published on 12 April 2023, so Y needs to file this by 12 October 2023.\n- EPC Rule 47a(2) requires that the new representative be authorized in writing by the applicant before or at the same time as filing a response under Article 84. Since X was the initial representative and is no longer representing the applicant, Y must obtain proper authorization from the applicant to act as their representative.\n\nOption B does not mention obtaining written authorization from the applicant, which is required.\nOption C incorrectly sets the deadline for filing the response later than necessary (23 October 2023 instead of 12 October 2023).\nOption D also has an incorrect deadline and unnecessarily mentions a date that has already passed (23 October 2023).\n\nThus, option A is the correct choice as it includes all necessary steps to validly appoint representative Y.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 151, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r151.html\nSource: EPC Article 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a11.html\nSource: EPC Rule 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r9.html\nSource: EPC Article 75, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a75.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:** According to EPC Article 122, an applicant can request re-establishment of rights if they were unable to observe a time limit due to circumstances beyond their control. The Act revising the European Patent Convention (footnote Ref141) and the Implementing Regulations provide that requests for re-establishment of rights may be granted under specific conditions, including the payment of fees as required by the Implementing Regulations. Therefore, it is possible to remedy a missed time limit such as paying the designation fee through a request for re-establishment of rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** EPC Article 94 (2) states that if no request for examination is filed before the European search report has been transmitted, the application may be deemed withdrawn. There is no provision in the EPC that allows an applicant to request re-establishment of rights specifically for missing a time limit related to requesting examination.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** EPC Article 93 (1) outlines the time limits for filing applications based on priority dates, and failure to meet these deadlines generally leads to the application not being processed. According to EPC Article 122, re-establishment of rights can only be sought if an applicant fails to observe a time limit due to circumstances beyond their control, but missing the filing deadline within the priority period is usually deemed non-compliance with procedural requirements and cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The fee for re-establishment of rights itself can be paid as part of the request process (as per EPC Article 122), but it does not constitute a missed time limit that could be re-established. Instead, this fee is related to the remedy process once the application has been deemed withdrawn or non-compliant due to procedural issues. Therefore, missing such a fee cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights for another unrelated procedural issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the only option that can potentially be remedied through a request for re-establishment of rights is A (the time limit for paying the designation fee).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 122, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a122.html\nSource: EPC Article 94, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a94.html\nSource: EPC Article 93, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a93.html\nSource: EPC Article 121, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a121.html\nSource: EPC Rule 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r70.html"

In this case, Spanish European patent attorneys are eligible for a fee reduction if they file a European patent application in their own language (Spanish) for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and an Andorran national. Therefore, option A fits the criteria.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect**: The fact that one of the applicants has a German principal place of business with 200 employees and a high annual turnover does not qualify them for a fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC. This option only mentions nationality (Dutch) which is not sufficient to establish eligibility for a fee reduction.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: A natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality does not meet the criteria for any specific fee reductions listed in Rule 6 EPC, as it does not mention countries with special entitlements or categories of applicants (e.g., certain nationalities or professionals) that qualify for reduced fees.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: A natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality filing a European patent application in Italian does not meet the criteria for any specific fee reductions listed in Rule 6 EPC.

In this case, EP-div was filed in Dutch, which is also the language of EP-parent.

Therefore, Mr Van Holland must file an English translation of EP-div together with a request for further processing to comply with EPC requirements.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While Rule 112(1) EPC pertains to the communication informing the applicant about loss of rights due to non-payment of fees or other deficiencies, it does not provide a timeline for filing translations.

Since you wish to validate the patent only in two contracting states, you will need to pay the fourth-year renewal fee separately in those two states. Additionally, as per Article 86(1) EPC and Rule 75(2) Implementing Regulations, if a renewal fee is not paid by the due date, it can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 months from the due date (in this case, 16 November 2023 + 9 months = 14 August 2024). However, for the fourth year, you have a grace period of up to 1 January following the due date. Therefore, you can validly pay the renewal fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The due date for the fourth-year renewal fee in each state where the patent is validated should be on 16 November 2023 (one year after filing). Paying it later would result in a delay and could incur additional fees or penalties, but not until 9 January 2024 at the latest.\n\n- **Explanation of why A and D are incorrect**: Both options A and D suggest that the due date for payment is on 16 November 2023. While this might be correct for a central fee to the EPO in some cases, it does not account for the fact that you need to pay separately in each contracting state where validation takes place.

Therefore, these options do not align with the available choices under the PCT rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Article 11, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a11.html\nSource: PCT Article 36, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a36.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to EPC Rule 52(1), if a priority claim is not properly made at the time of filing, it can be added within a period of twelve months from the date of filing. Since applicant P filed on 20 June 2023 and today is 12 October 2023, there are still more than two months left in this one-year period until 20 June 2024. Hence, the missing priority claim can still be validly added by the expiry date of 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The time limit for adding the priority claim does not extend beyond the end of the twelve-month period from the filing date of 20 June 2023, so it cannot expire on a later date than this.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Although applicant P discovers the omission today (12 October 2023), they still have more than two months to add the priority claim before the expiry of the twelve-month period on 20 June 2024, and therefore 20 October 2023 does not mark the end of the time limit.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The omission from EP -II should be reported as soon as it was discovered. Under EPC Rule 59, applicant P would have been informed about any deficiencies in claiming priority and invited to file them within a period to be specified. Since the filing date for EP -II is earlier than that of the international application, adding the claim after this period expired on 3 July 2023 would not be valid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html\nSource: EPC Rule 52, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r52.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: PCT Rule 64, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r64.html\nSource: EPC Rule 59, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r59.html"

There is no indication that an extension or additional fee is required for filing timely comments.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The opponent/ respondent did not exceed the specified period and therefore does not need to request an extension.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** No additional fees are mentioned as a requirement in EPC Rule 100(2) or any other relevant rule for submitting timely comments on an appeal.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The opponent/ respondent has already submitted their comments within the specified period. There is no basis for filing a request for reestablishment of rights, as they have not missed the deadline and are not claiming any specific procedural irregularities that would justify such a request according to EPC Rule 134. This rule addresses situations where there was an error in the proceedings that prevented timely action by the party, which is not applicable here since the comments were submitted on time. Therefore, none of the options A, B, or C are necessary actions for this scenario. \n\nThus, the correct answer is D: None of the above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html\nSource: EPC Rule 79, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r79.html\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: EPC Rule 111, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r111.html"

In this case, since the applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed on October 12, 2023, the deadline to pay the renewal fees for the third and fourth years (years 2023 and 2024) is six months after October 12, 2023. This corresponds to April 12, 2024. Therefore, paying by October 31, 2023, would be too early and not necessary due to the grace period provided. \n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because Rule 51(2) does not state that non-payment of renewal fees results in automatic withdrawal of the application.\n\n- **Option C** suggests a deadline of April 30, 2024, which would be correct but is more than six months after the notification, so it's not the most accurate answer within the given options.\n\n- **Option D** suggests paying by October 31, 2023, without an additional fee, which is incorrect as this date precedes the grace period provided for renewal fees.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC RFees 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

Since there is no claim to any priority, the renewal fee for the third year (due at 36 months from the filing date) is not applicable yet.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Appointing a representative is not mandatory unless specified in the regulations or if the applicant desires representation, and is not required solely for entering the EP phase.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to EPC Rule 17, specifically paragraphs (2) and (3), the designation fee can be refunded if the European patent application is withdrawn after substantive examination has begun but before a specific timeframe. The relevant part states that the refund \"shall be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the new application.\" Therefore, to withdraw the application and potentially qualify for a designation fee refund, the applicant must do so no later than six months after the mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: While it might seem logical that one could withdraw an application immediately upon receiving notice of the search report being published (since this would prevent substantive examination from proceeding), Rule 17 does not allow for such early withdrawal to qualify for a refund. The applicant must wait until after substantive examination has begun, which typically occurs after the publication date.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The EPC RFees 11 article mentioned clearly outlines conditions under which designation fees can be refunded, and one of those conditions is the application being withdrawn after substantive examination has commenced but before certain deadlines. Therefore, once the fee was validly paid, it does not become irrevocable or unrefundable; rather, there are specific times when a refund might still be possible.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The date of the start of substantive examination is not relevant to determining the period during which an application can be withdrawn in order to seek a designation fee refund. Substantive examination generally starts after the publication of the search report, and the timeframe for potential withdrawal and seeking refunds is based on this later date. Hence, it does not align with the correct answer provided by EPC rules. \n\nTherefore, the latest point in time for withdrawing the application to potentially obtain a refund of the designation fee is six months after the mention of the publication of the European search report. The correct choice is A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC RFees 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f11.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html"

This includes a debit order. The filing fee and other fees can be debited from an applicant's account only if the relevant procedures are followed according to Article 5. Paragraphs 2 RFees specify that a debit order should be executed within the period in which the payment should have been made, or earlier. In this case, the debit order is scheduled for execution on 18 October 2024 and must be revoked by 17 October 2024 to avoid debiting the renewal fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Revoking a debit order after its execution date (18 October 2024) would result in an unwanted deduction from the deposit account, as it will already have been processed on that day.\n  \n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The evening of 10 October 2024 is too early to execute a debit order for fees not yet due. The correct period for revocation extends until just before or at 17 October 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While a full cancellation of a debit order is possible, the question specifically asks about revoking the part related to the renewal fee, which can be done within the stipulated period. Therefore, partial revocation is feasible and relevant here.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 57, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r57.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC RFees 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f7.html"

The time limit for filing such an appeal is four months from the date of notification of the decision (Article 134(1) and (3) EPC). Therefore, option A is correct as it provides a means for the applicant to challenge the decision.\n\n- **Option B is incorrect**: There is no provision in Article 97 or Rule 60 EPC that allows an applicant to file a \"request for further processing\" within two months of receiving a refusal decision. The only relevant provisions are for appeals and re-establishment of rights, not additional requests for processing.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: While the applicant can indeed seek re-establishment of rights under Article 123 EPC (see also Rule 64(2) EPC), the time limit to file such a request is not two months after receiving the refusal decision. Typically, the time limit for filing requests for re-establishment of rights depends on the specific circumstances and can be longer than two months.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: As explained above, option C is not correct; therefore, option D cannot be correct as it includes an incorrect statement (option C).\n\nIn conclusion, the applicant's best course of action is to file a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision.

This aligns with option D stating that \"Third-party observations can be filed after the publication of a European patent application and must be filed in an official language of the EPO.\" Additionally, EPC Rule 114 (1) requires that any observations by a third party shall be filed in writing in an official language of the European Patent Office. Therefore, option D correctly reflects the legal requirements for filing third-party observations.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The statement \"Third-party observations must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously\" does not accurately reflect EPC Article 115 or Rule 114. While third-party observations must indeed be filed in writing, there is no explicit prohibition against filing them anonymously; the requirement for written submissions only ensures that the grounds on which they are based can be properly addressed.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The statement \"Third-party observations are considered by the examining division only if they include a statement of the grounds on which they are based, and an official fee is paid\" is incorrect. EPC Article 115 does not mention any requirement for a fee to be paid or for the grounds on which the observations are based as a prerequisite for consideration. The requirement to state the grounds (EPC Rule 114 (1)) pertains to the process of filing, not to the consideration by the examining division.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Option A incorrectly states that \"The person that filed third-party observations will be a party to the proceedings before the EPO.\" According to Article 115 and Rule 114, third parties are not considered parties in the proceedings but can submit observations. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that the applicant is obliged to respond; while the applicant may receive notifications of such observations (EPC Rule 73(2)), there is no explicit obligation on the part of the applicant to provide a response as per EPC provisions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: EPC Article 115, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a115.html\nSource: EPC Rule 83, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r83.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71.html\nSource: EPC Rule 117, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r117.html"

Here, since you are responding by paying additional search fees for the three inventions identified, the applicable deadline is one month after receiving the communication, which is 25 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: You do need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. Even if you disagree with the ISA's assessment, you are required to provide a response or pay additional fees within the given time limit.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: If you decide to pay under protest, EPC Rule 153(2) states that you must pay the fee for the search and also the protest fee. However, this scenario does not indicate an intention to protest; it simply requires additional payment as per the ISA's communication.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The statement \"if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn\" is overly broad and not specific to this scenario. You are only required to respond by paying the additional search fee within one month as per EPC Article 17(2).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html\nSource: EPC Article 153, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a153.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html"

If such a decision is made and Firm B files an opposition, they are indeed entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision as per EPC Rule 103.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The statement \"At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to\" lacks clarity. It could imply a decision in favor or against the patent without specifying which party's claim was rejected. Furthermore, Firm C’s observations (under Article 115) are irrelevant to whether Firm B can appeal.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The decision to maintain the patent as granted means that all claims were found to be valid under EPC Article 101(2). Firm C did not oppose the patent, and thus cannot file an appeal against this favorable decision for Firm A.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** If Firm B withdrew its opposition, no decision would have been made regarding the patent.

However, the unitary effect had been registered on the same date (October 10, 2024), which is within the grace period of three months from the publication date, as per EPC Article 78(3). Therefore, the proprietor must pay the renewal fee for the year in which the mention was published, which is the 5th year.

                    "Justification": "- According to EPC Rule 80.2, the time limit for reply is calculated from the date on which a communication is posted, not the date it was received by the applicant. The communication dated 12 September 2024 sets a four-month time limit, thus ending on 12 January 2025.\n\n- **Option B (12 January 2025)**: This option incorrectly states that the last day is the same as the end of the period without considering the 28-day postal delay. Thus, it's incorrect.\n\n- **Option C (22 January 2025)**: This date adds an extra 14 days, which exceeds the four-month period by a significant amount and doesn’t align with Rule 80.2’s calculation method.\n\n- **Option D (14 January 2025)**: Adding only 14 days to the communication date is insufficient as it fails to account for the full four-month period starting from the posting date plus the postal delay, making this option incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is A, which accurately reflects the end of the time limit after adding four months to the posting date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: PCT Rule 66, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r66.html\nSource: EPC Rule 127, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r127.html\nSource: PCT Rule 22, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r22.html\nSource: PCT Rule 80, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r80.html"

                    "Justification": "- Option D is correct because according to the documents provided, MyEPO Portfolio can be used for filing via the EPO's Online Filing 2.0 (eOLF), which allows users to file their applications electronically directly from this platform. Additionally, it supports a Mailbox feature that enables communication with the Office regarding filed applications and searches. The patent search functionality is also available via the publication server, further enhancing the utility of MyEPO Portfolio.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because while the shared area with examiners and access to the European Patent Register are functionalities, the specific mention of filing via eOLF directly from MyEPO Portfolio is not detailed in any of the provided documents. Therefore, it does not fully encompass all the services that can be accessed through MyEPO Portfolio.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because although a shared area with examiners and replying to a communication under Article 94(3) EPC are functionalities available within MyEPO Portfolio, these do not cover filing or patent search via publication server. The Mailbox functionality exists but does not include replying specifically under Article 94(3) EPC as stated.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because while the Mailbox and patent search via the publication server are indeed services that can be accessed from MyEPO Portfolio, it misses out on the filing via eOLF service which is a key functionality available through this platform. Therefore, option D provides a more comprehensive list of services than options A, B, or C. \n\nIn summary, Option D accurately reflects the functionalities and services accessible directly from MyEPO Portfolio as supported by the provided documents.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 127, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r127.html\nSource: EPC Article 131, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a131.html\nSource: EPC Article 75, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a75.html\nSource: EPC Rule 73, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r73.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why C is correct:** EPO Contingency Upload Service is designed as an alternative method for submitting documents when the primary filing systems are not accessible due to a system outage. According to the context provided, it specifically mentions that in such scenarios, the service should be utilized (e.g., \"See notice from the EPO of 24.11.2023 concerning the discontinuation of issuing EPO smart cards\"). This aligns with option C.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The context does not suggest that the Contingency Upload Service should be used when the filing systems are functioning correctly, even if there's a technical issue at the user’s end. Such scenarios would likely be handled through internal troubleshooting or other support mechanisms rather than a contingency service.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** While business hours may involve temporary delays due to system maintenance or upgrades, the Contingency Upload Service is specifically mentioned in the context as a solution for when systems are down, not just unavailable during standard operating times. Therefore, it does not fit option A.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The EPO has multiple methods for handling submissions on days when it is officially closed (e.g., through pre-submissions or other designated filing periods), and the Contingency Upload Service is not mentioned as a solution for such events. This makes option D irrelevant to the recommendation of using this service.\n\nThus, C accurately reflects the intended use of the EPO Contingency Upload Service according to the provided context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 134, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r134.html\nSource: EPC Rule 83, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r83.html\nSource: EPC Rule 53, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r53.html\nSource: PCT Rule 20, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r20.html"

Since Korhonen originally filed his application in Finnish, he can file amended claims in Finnish and must then provide a translation into any official language of the EPO (English is an official language) in time.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because it states that Korhonen must file the claims in Finnish first before providing a translation. This does not align with the requirement to submit amendments in one of the official languages directly and then provide a translation if necessary.\n  \n- **Option B** is technically correct but incomplete, as it omits the part about filing the translation into an official language within the required time limit.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because there are no restrictions on Korhonen being able to file the amended claims in Finnish; he can do so and must provide a translation if necessary.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: EPC Rule 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r6.html\nSource: PCT Rule 26, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r26.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html"

The availability of PCT Direct is contingent on specific conditions outlined by the EPO that do not include this scenario.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect.** In this case, both the priority application and the international application are in English (albeit the priority application was filed under an EP system), and they meet the requirements for using Online Filing 2.0.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect.** Here, the initial application and subsequent filings align with PCT Direct criteria, including being processed by the EPO and utilizing Online Filing 2.0 for English filings.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect.** The requirement to file amended claims with the PCT Direct letter is not a condition specific to its availability; it may be required depending on the circumstances but does not disqualify an application from using PCT Direct if other conditions are met.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: EPC Rule 161, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r161.html\nSource: PCT Article 11, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a11.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to Article 65 EPC, any Contracting State may prescribe that the proprietor of a European patent must provide a translation of the patent into one of its official languages. Since Mr Linguist would like unitary effect in states which officially use English, French or German as an official language (as per Article 14(1) EPC), he needs to provide a translation of the specification into one of these three languages.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: Providing a translation only into Dutch, the original language of application, does not meet the requirement for unitary effect in other Contracting States with different official languages.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The UPCA (Unitary Patent Package Agreement) has 18 contracting states as of now and 24 signing states. The exact number of states that have officially signed the UPCA does not dictate the language for translations under EPC, only the official languages of the Contracting States involved.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Spanish is not one of the official languages of any of the Contracting States to which Mr Linguist would be applying unitary effect. Thus, providing a translation into Spanish would not satisfy the requirement set by Article 65 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: EPC Article 65, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a65.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html"
