Since no opposition was filed and thus no proceedings are currently pending (as stated in option B), Ms Smith can no longer be deleted as inventor without her consent.\n\nWhy Option A is incorrect: The guidelines do not specify that a patent proprietor can unilaterally request the deletion of an erroneously designated inventor if no opposition or other proceedings are pending. The correct procedure requires the consent of the erroneous inventor, making option A inaccurate in this context.\n\nWhy Option C is incorrect: Option C implies that Mr Li's consent would be required for Ms Smith to be deleted as an inventor. According to the provided legal text, there is no mention or requirement for another inventor’s consent when correcting an error in inventorship before proceedings are pending.\n\nWhy Option D is incorrect: While it might seem plausible that the erroneous inventor (Ms Smith) would need to agree to her name being removed from the patent, based on the provided legal text, there is no indication that Ms Smith's consent alone is required for this correction; rather, it must be done before any proceedings are initiated. If an opposition or other proceedings were pending, her consent might indeed be necessary, but since none are mentioned, option D is incorrect.\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_3_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 78, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r78.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 13, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_13.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_2_1.html"

The relevant sections in the Guidelines for Examination state that if certain requirements are not met, such as paying fees or providing necessary information (Rules 40(1)(a) and (c)), an applicant may seek to restore their rights through Article 122.\n\n- **Option A: Time limit for paying the designation fee**: According to Rule 76 of the European Patent Convention (EPC), the time limit for paying the designation fees is not covered by re-establishment of rights under Article 122. This is a different process and typically requires timely action.\n  \n- **Option B: Time limit for requesting examination**: The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, specify that if Rule 40(1)(a) or (c) are not met, an applicant can request re-establishment of rights under Article 122 to address deficiencies such as these. Therefore, this is a correct option.\n\n- **Option C: Time limit for filing the application within the priority period**: The provisions in F-VI, 1.3, concerning the time frame for claiming a priority (within twelve months) do not explicitly state that re-establishment of rights can be sought after missing it. Instead, it is about following the procedural rules correctly to claim priority.\n\n- **Option D: Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights**: This option does not align with any specific legal text provided in the context of requesting re-establishment of rights under Article 122 of the EPC. The focus of seeking re-establishment is on time limits that can be corrected, such as those outlined in Rule 40.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 122, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a122.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html"

Additionally, nationals of such states who are resident abroad may also benefit from this rule. Option B correctly fits these criteria: it describes a situation where a firm (a legal person) whose principal place of business is in Germany files a European patent application in Dutch (an admissible non-EPO language), and the natural person filing jointly is resident in Germany, which fulfills the condition for applying the language privilege. This would entitle them to file documents in Dutch with a translation into an EPO official language as per Art. 14(4) of the EPC.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Andorra's official languages are Catalan and Spanish; neither is listed among the admissible non-EPO languages, nor does it have a different official language than those specified. Option C is also incorrect since the filing must be done in an admissible non-EPO language for fee reduction purposes, and French is one of EPO’s official languages (Art. 14(4) EPC). Similarly, option D is incorrect as Swiss nationals are not residents or principal places of business within a contracting state that has a different official language than English, French, or German.\n\nTherefore, only Option B correctly describes a situation where the applicant would be entitled to fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html\nSource: EPC Article 135, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a135.html\nSource: EPC Article 58, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a58.html\nSource: EPC Article 59, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a59.html\nSource: EPC Article 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a60.html"

This corresponds directly to option B. Option C suggests that Mr. Van Holland needs to file a translation together with a request for further processing. While it is true that he must file a translation if he wants any further processing, the requirement mentioned under Rule 58 allows him to rectify the deficiency alone by filing the translation within the given timeframe. Option D implies re-establishment of rights would be necessary. However, according to E-VIII, 2, where an application is deemed withdrawn due to non-compliance with requirements for supplying a translation, it can be re-established if the applicant files the translation and a valid request for further processing (including payment) within two months from notification. Option A states that the deficiency cannot be remedied.

Since no further amendments were filed with the EPO upon entry into the regional phase and there is no request for international preliminary examination (which means no IPER was prepared), the communication under Rule 161/162 will be Form 1226BB, offering the opportunity to comment on and possibly file additional amendments. \n\n- **Why Option A is Incorrect:** Form 1226AA is typically used for communications that require immediate attention due to time-sensitive deadlines. Given that no further amendments were filed in this case, a more routine communication will be issued rather than one with such urgency.\n\n- **Why Option C is Incorrect:** Since there was no request for international preliminary examination, the EPO did not prepare an IPER (International Preliminary Examination Report), which would normally lead to the issuance of Form 1226CC. Therefore, this option does not apply in the given scenario.\n\n- **Why Option D is Incorrect:** Form 1226AC indicates that the examination has already started.

In this case, the latest European patent application (EP -I filed on 7 July 2022) was filed after EP -II (filed on 3 July 2022), which means that applicant P would have until 6 months after the filing date of EP-I to add or correct the priority claim. The filing date of EP-I is 7 July 2022, so adding the priority from EP-II by today's date (12 October 2023) falls within this six-month period.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests a deadline on 3 November 2023, which would be one day too late as per R.52(3) EPC.\nOption C is incorrect because it implies that the time limit expired on 20 October 2023, which is before the six-month period has elapsed from the filing date of EP-I.\nOption D is incorrect since it states that the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023, when in reality, there was a six-month period to add or correct the priority claim from 7 July 2022.\n\nTherefore, according to the legal text provided and applying R.52(3) EPC, Answer B is the correct choice, as the time limit for adding the missing priority claim expires on 7 November 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html"

The patent proprietor filed an appeal in time.\n3. The board of appeal forwarded a copy of the appeal, along with a communication dated 1 June 2023, giving the opponent/respondent an opportunity to file comments within four months.\n\nThe opponent/respondent submitted their comments on 12 October 2023, which is well within the provided four-month period (by 4 July 2023). Therefore, no further action in terms of requesting an extension, paying a fee for further processing, or filing a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights is required.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A: The opponent/ respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.** - This option is incorrect because the comments were submitted within the provided four-month period.\n- **Option B: The opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing.** - There is no indication that any additional fees are required since the opponent responded on time and did not exceed the given period.\n- **Option C: The opponent/respondent needs to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee.** - This option is incorrect because there was no indication or requirement for the opponent to apply for reestablishment of rights, as the comments were submitted within the specified timeframe.\n\nTherefore, none of the listed actions (A, B, C) are necessary in this scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 79, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r79.html\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_4_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.6.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_6_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to Rule 51(1) EPC, a renewal fee for the third year can be paid up to six months before it falls due without an additional fee. The third-year renewal fee in this case would have been due by 20 March 2023 (six months after 20 September 2022). Since proceedings were interrupted on 10 March 2022, and the applicant was informed that they will be resumed today, 12 October 2023, it means the third-year renewal fee would have been due around this time. Thus, if paid by 12 October 2023 (the date of resumption), it can still be validly paid without any additional fee.\n\nOption B is correct because as of today, 12 October 2023, the third-year renewal fee can indeed be validly paid without an additional fee up to the latest by 12 October 2023 (which aligns with option B).\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A is incorrect because Rule 51(4) EPC states that if a European patent application has been refused or deemed withdrawn due to non-observance of a time limit and the applicant's rights are re-established, the renewal fee would be paid on the date of notification of such re-establishment. However, there is no mention in the question that the application was refused or deemed withdrawn; it was merely interrupted.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because while Rule 51(2) EPC allows for payment of renewal fees within six months with an additional fee, this provision only applies after the due date has passed and not before. Thus, paying by 30 April 2024 (six months from today) would be too late.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because Rule 51(1) EPC explicitly states that renewal fees can be paid up to six months before they fall due without an additional fee. Since the latest payment date for the third-year renewal fee, based on the given timeline, should not exceed 12 October 2023, paying by 31 October 2023 would be after this deadline and could still require an additional fee if paid past the original due date without it.\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

This means that only the requirements stated under Rule 159(1)(c) need to be fulfilled at this stage. Under Rule 159(1)(c), 'The applicant shall pay the fee referred to in paragraph (b). The fee is fixed by Decision G 3/08 of the Enlarged Board of Appeal. When a request for early processing has been filed, it is necessary to file Form 1200 and pay the search fee.' A request for early processing being already filed implies that there are no additional fees such as the renewal fee for the third year (as in Option B) or an appointment of a representative (as in Option C) at this point.

If the applicant wishes to obtain a refund of this fee, they can do so by withdrawing the application before the expiration of this period.\\n\\n**Why B is incorrect:** Option B refers to the date of mention of the publication of the European search report, which is when the designation fee must be paid but not when it can be refunded. According to EPC Rule 36(4), there is a specific six-month window during which the applicant may withdraw and seek a refund of this fee.\\n\\n**Why C is incorrect:** Option C states that 'the designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded.' This is incorrect because, as per EPC Rule 36, if the application is withdrawn within the specified six-month period after the mention in the European Patent Bulletin, a refund of the designation fee may still be obtained.\\n\\n**Why D is incorrect:** Option D mentions the date of the start of substantive examination. According to the provided text and applicable rules, there is no specific provision that allows for the refund of fees once substantive examination has begun. The time period for withdrawing an application and potentially receiving a refund pertains to the period immediately following the publication of the search report, as outlined in EPC Rule 36(4).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 36, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r36.html"

Additionally, Point 10.3 ADA states that for a revocation notice to be effective, it must be received no later than the date of receipt of the debit order. In this case, the debit order is specified to execute payment on 18 October 2024, meaning the latest point in time for revoking the renewal fee (to be debited on that day) would be before or by 17 October 2024.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Answer A. 10 October 2024 is too early as the notice must be received no later than the date of receipt, which in this case is 18 October 2024.\n- Answer C. 18 October 2024 is not correct because it would make the revocation effective on the same day as the intended execution of the payment, rendering it ineffective.\n- Answer D. A debit order cannot be revoked in part is incorrect according to the guidelines provided by Point 10.2 ADA and 10.3 ADA, which explicitly allow for revocation or modification of a partial portion of a debit order.\n\nTherefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee is 17 October 2024 (Answer B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html"

Firm B is entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision.\n\n- **Explanation:**\n  - According to the legal text provided in Case Law IV, C.1, opposition has neither suspensive effect nor the effect of transferring the case to a superior instance. This means that if the opposition division decides to maintain the patent as granted at the end of the proceedings, firm B (the opponent) is entitled to file an appeal against this decision.\n\n- **Why Option A is Incorrect:**\n  - The statement incorrectly suggests that Firm B can file an appeal even after a revocation. Based on the legal text provided in Case Law IV, C.1, opposition proceedings do not have a suspensive effect, meaning that firm B would be allowed to appeal regardless of whether the patent was revoked or maintained.\n\n- **Why Option C is Incorrect:**\n  - The statement incorrectly suggests that Firm C can file an appeal against the decision. According to Case Law IV, C.1, only parties who have filed a formal opposition (i.e., firm B) are entitled to appeal decisions of the opposition division. Firm C's role was merely as an observer and did not directly challenge the patent, thus it is not entitled to file an appeal.\n\n- **Why Option D is Incorrect:**\n  - The statement incorrectly suggests that firm B would be able to appeal after withdrawing its opposition. According to Case Law IV, C.1, withdrawal of an opposition typically does not affect a party's right to appeal against the decision if the opposition division has already made a substantive decision on the patent’s validity.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law IV, D.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_d_1.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_1_4.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_8_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_1.html"

For the 5th year, this would be 31 October 2024. The unitary effect was registered for EP -X-C0 on 2 October 2024, and communication regarding registration of unitary effect was sent to the proprietor on 10 October 2024. Since the mention of the grant was published on 2 October 2024, it means that the first year (the period from 1 October 2020 to 31 October 2021) does not count in terms of renewal fees for the unitary patent. Thus, the proprietor would need to pay the renewal fee for the 5th year on 31 October 2024.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the 5th year of a European patent runs from 1 October 2023 to 31 October 2024, and therefore the fee would be due on 31 October 2024, not by that date.\nOption C is incorrect because the 6th year starts after the 5th year ends, so a renewal fee for the 6th year (due on 31 October 2025) has not yet become due as of 31 October 2024.\nOption D is incorrect because since unitary effect was registered and the proprietor must pay the renewal fees, no exemption from paying a renewal fee exists.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC RFees 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f2.html"

The calculation shows that adding four months and then subtracting the two extra days from the receipt date brings us to 13 January, not 22 January.\nD. 14 January 2025 is also incorrect because it adds an unnecessary day beyond what the correct calculation shows.\n\nThus, the last day for replying to the communication on 12 September 2024 with receipt on 21 September 2024 would be 13 January 2025.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_4.html\nSource: PCT Rule 66, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r66.html\nSource: PCT Rule 80, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r80.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal context, MyEPO Portfolio allows for functionalities such as access to a shared area with examiners and interacting with the Mailbox service. The text specifically mentions that certain procedural acts may be filed electronically using MyEPO Portfolio, which includes communication under Article 94(3) EPC, indicating the ability to reply to communications.\n\n- **Option A is incorrect**: The context does not support accessing the European Patent Register or filing via the EPO's legacy Online Filing software (eOLF) through MyEPO Portfolio. It explicitly states that these functionalities are not possible.\n  \n- **Option C is incorrect**: While a shared area with examiners and Mailbox services are mentioned, patent search via the publication server is not supported by the provided text for MyEPO Portfolio. The context does not indicate access to the European Publication Server through this service.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: Although filing via Online Filing 2.0 is possible through other means (like eFiles), it is explicitly stated that the functionalities such as accessing a shared area with examiners and replying to communications under Article 94(3) EPC are only available through MyEPO Portfolio, making this option incomplete.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided legal context, the correct answer is Option B. Mailbox and a shared area with examiners, along with replying to a communication under Article 94(3) EPC, can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal texts and the guidelines from the European Patent Office (EPO), an applicant is allowed to file a European patent application in any language as long as it complies with Article 5 of the Patents Convention (PLT) and provides a translation into one of the official languages of the EPO if filed in another language. In this scenario, Applicant Korhonen filed his application in Finnish, which is not an official language of the EPO, but provided a timely English translation. This complies with Article 14(2) EPC and Rule 6 of the EPC.\n\nFor responses to communications from the European Patent Office, such as the extended European search report (EESR), applicants must ensure that any new documents, including amended claims, are filed in one of the official languages of the EPO. If an amendment is made to the application, it can be submitted in the language used for the original filing but must still provide a translation into one of the official languages within the prescribed time limits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because although the applicant would need to file the amended claims together with a translation, the initial filing does not require being in Finnish if accompanied by a timely translation.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because while it mentions providing a translation 'in any official language of the EPO,' it omits specifying that the original application must be filed in one of the EPO's official languages. The requirement for a translation into an official language applies only to non-official language filings, which does not apply here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no prohibition against filing amended claims together with a request for examination in Finnish if accompanied by a timely translation into English or any other official language of the EPO as required. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: Korhonen is allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish if he then provides a translation into English, in time.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r6.html"

                    "Justification": "Option B is incorrect because the priority application must have been filed with the EPO if PCT Direct is to be available for it. An EP application (European Patent application) filed in France would not qualify since an EP application can only be filed directly with the EPO, and such a filing typically does not involve the process of being a 'priority' application for PCT purposes.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Article 70(1) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), 'The text of a European patent application or a European patent in the language of the proceedings shall be the authentic text...'. In this case, Mr. Linguist filed his application in Dutch but used English as the language of the proceedings. Therefore, under Article 70(2) of the EPC, which states that if an application is filed in a non-official language, 'that text shall be the application as filed within the meaning of this Convention,' the authentic text would be the original Dutch text since it was used during the proceedings.\n\nHowever, when requesting unitary effect under Article 137(2)(b) EPC, any central industrial property office can require a translation into one of its official languages. Therefore, Mr. Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B is correct).\n\nWhy Options A, C, and D are incorrect:\n- Option A suggests providing a translation in Dutch, but since the application was filed in Dutch and used during the proceedings, no additional Dutch translation is required for the unitary effect request.\n- Option C pertains to states that have signed the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA), which is not relevant here because the question specifically mentions Mr. Linguist requesting immediate registration of the unitary effect, implying a broader scope than just UPCA signatories.\n- Option D suggests providing a translation in Spanish, but there is no requirement or legal basis for selecting Spanish as an official language for this request; it must be one of the official languages of the states to which the unitary effect extends. Since not all states use Spanish, this option is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that Mr. Linguist must provide a translation into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 137, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a137.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html"
