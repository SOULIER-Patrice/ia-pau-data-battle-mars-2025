Option B is correct because the applicant can file a request for further processing under Rule 60 EPC within two months from notification of the refusal decision if they wish to provide the designation of inventor or any other missing information. Option C is correct because under Article 122(1) EPC, re-establishment of rights can be requested when an applicant was unable to observe a time limit due to unforeseen circumstances despite taking all due care.

Additionally, Rule 114(1) EPC requires that such observations be filed in writing and must be in one of the official languages of the European Patent Office (EPO). This is consistent with the legal context provided. A is incorrect because third-party observers are not parties to the proceedings before the EPO, and while applicants may respond to such observations, they are not obliged to do so according to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO. B is incorrect because it incorrectly asserts that third-party observations cannot be filed anonymously; the Guidelines for Examination state: 'Observations may be filed anonymously.' C is incorrect because there is no requirement to pay an official fee when filing third-party observations, as mentioned in both Article 115 EPC and Rule 114(1) EPC. Furthermore, while the observations must include a statement of grounds (as required by Rule 114), this does not limit their consideration solely based on having such a statement.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

In this case, you received the communication on 25 September 2024, so the time limit to pay the additional search fees would end by 25 November 2024 (two months after receipt). Therefore, statement A is correct as it aligns with the requirement that two additional search fees must be paid within this specified period. Options B and C are incorrect because Rule 64 does not mention any exemption from responding to unity of invention requirements or introducing unnecessary protest fees when paying additional search fees under protest. Option D is also incorrect, as if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, your application will proceed with only the partial search results for the first invention or group of inventions mentioned in the claims but would not be withdrawn.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_2_3.html\nSource: EPC Rule 158, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r158.html\nSource: EPC Rule 164, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r164.html\nSource: EPC Rule 64, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r64.html"

This means that filing a certified copy directly to the appropriate authority - in this case, the International Bureau - ensures compliance with procedural requirements. Requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LU IPO) to send the certified copy to the EPO or submitting a valid DAS (Digital Access Service) code to the International Bureau are not correct methods because these options do not comply with the procedure for filing a certified copy as required by the Guidelines.

The standard processes and systems should be sufficient during normal operations, including after-hours submissions through other electronic methods. Option B is incorrect as well. If only a technical issue at your end arises while the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, you would typically resolve or work around that issue without needing to use the Contingency Upload Service, which implies broader system failure rather than individual user issues. Option D is also incorrect because official holidays should not require special document submission methods.
