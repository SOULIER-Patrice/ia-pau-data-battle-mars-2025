According to the provided legal text, an applicant for a European patent can apply to have their rights re-established if they were unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO despite taking all due care required by the circumstances (see Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3). This includes missed payment deadlines such as the designation fee. The text does not specifically mention that re-establishment of rights can be used for other time limits like requesting examination, filing within the priority period, or paying a fee for re-establishment (options B, C, and D).\n\nOption B is incorrect because the text outlines specific procedures for requesting further processing, which are different from re-establishment of rights. The process for re-establishing rights does not cover missed deadlines for actions like requesting examination.\n\nOption C is incorrect as there is no mention of using re-establishment of rights for filing within the priority period. Generally, such issues would be resolved by re-filing the application or other means, but this specific context in the text does not indicate that re-establishment of rights can be used here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because paying a fee for re-establishment itself cannot be remedied through re-establishment of rights; it’s the missed payment deadline that could potentially be resolved by applying for re-establishment. The process of requesting re-establishment of rights does not involve an additional fee payment.\n\nSources:\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

In this case, since Mr Van Holland's parent application was filed in Dutch, which is an admissible non-EPO language under R.6(3)-(7), he needs to file an English translation of EP-div within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC (as per B option). \n\nOption A states that the deficiency cannot be remedied, which is incorrect because a remedy exists as outlined in R.36(2).\n\nOption C suggests filing both an English translation and a request for further processing, but this is not necessary according to the legal text provided. Filing the required translation within two months suffices.\n\nOption D proposes filing an English translation and a request for re-establishment of rights. This is incorrect because there is no indication that Mr Van Holland has lost his rights due to non-compliance with language requirements, only that he needs to file the translation as per R.36(2).

The legal consequence laid down in Article 86, paragraph 1, will ensue upon expiry of the six-month period.\n\nThe communication states that the decision to grant a European patent was notified on 8 January 2014, which means the fourth year's renewal fee falls due on 30 November 2023 (as per Rule 51(1)). Thus, the renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid centrally to the EPO and the due date is 30 November 2023.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states the due date is on 16 November 2023, which is not in accordance with Rule 51(1) of the EPC.\n\nOption C is incorrect because although it correctly identifies that the renewal fee must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated (Article 87 and Article 141 EPC), it incorrectly states that the fourth year's renewal fee can be validly paid until January 9, 2024.

However, since only one option must be selected from A to D as per the question structure, Option A is selected as it directly relates to the EPO being chosen alongside another international office, matching the format of the provided options.\n\nSources:\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B because under Article 87(4) of the EPC as per the provided legal text, if multiple priorities are claimed for a European patent application, time limits which run from the date of priority will run from the earliest date of priority. In this case, EP-I was filed on July 7, 2022, and EP-II on July 3, 2022, with EP-II being earlier. The applicant originally claimed priority to EP-I in the international application PCT-P on June 20, 2023. According to Rule 19(1) of the EPC, the time limit for claiming a missing priority is two months from the filing date of the original application (in this case, PCT-P), which would end on August 20, 2023.\n\nHowever, since EP-II was filed earlier, the period to claim its priority should run from July 3, 2022. Therefore, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires two months after that date, or by November 3, 2023.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests the period ends on November 3, not considering EP-II's filing date.\nOption C is incorrect as the period would end in August 2023, not October 2023.\nOption D is incorrect since the time limit for adding the priority claim did not expire until two months after July 3, 2023, which was on September 2, 2023. \n\nSources:\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

In this case, the opponent/ respondent has filed comments beyond the four-month period specified in the communication from the board of appeal. Therefore, they need to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\nOption B (pay a fee for further processing) and Option C (file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee) are incorrect because there is no indication that any procedural error has occurred or that the opponent/ respondent needs to reestablish their rights. The situation calls for an extension of time as per Rule 100(3).\n\nOption D (none of the above) is incorrect because Option A is a valid course of action based on the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

This includes paying the filing fee under Rule 159(1)(c). Since a request for early processing has been filed, it is implied that the other required actions are being pursued in time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the renewal fee for the third year (under EPC Article 86, paragraph 1) is only due if the fee has fallen due earlier under Rule 51(1). In this case, since no priority was claimed and the application has not yet reached its third year, this fee does not apply.\n\nOption C is incorrect because appointing a representative (under EPC Article 94) is not a mandatory action for entering the European phase according to the provided rule text. The applicant must only pay the filing fee and search fee, which they are already required to do under Rule 159(1)(c).\n\nOption D is incorrect because Option A accurately reflects all actions that need to be taken as per EPC Rule 159.\n\nSources:\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

The text also mentions that these observations must be in an official language of the EPO.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that 'the person that filed third-party observations will be a party to the proceedings before the EPO,' which contradicts the information provided, as third parties are not considered parties but can file observations. Furthermore, while options B and C suggest requirements for filing, the correct statement from D more accurately reflects the provided legal text.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it states that 'third-party observations must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously,' whereas the text allows for anonymous filings under certain conditions.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it claims that an official fee needs to be paid.

In this case, you received such a communication on 25 September 2024 and have until 25 October 2024 to pay any required additional search fees.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because EPC Rule 64(1) states that the ISA must inform the applicant about the partial search report, which implies that you should respond with a statement or a request for further information if necessary.\n- Option C is incorrect according to EPC Rule 70(2)(b), which does not mention protest fees when paying under protest. Therefore, there's no obligation to pay two protest fees within the time limit as stated in this option.\n- Option D is incorrect because if you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the EPO may issue a report on those parts of your application for which the fee has been paid and continue examination.

Therefore, option A 'Request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO' is the correct course of action.\n\n    Option B is incorrect because submitting a valid DAS (Digital Access Service) code enables the International Bureau or EPO to access digital copies of documents, but it does not directly result in receiving a certified copy from the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office. \n   \n    Option C 'File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO' is incorrect because according to the guidelines mentioned, the EPO will obtain and provide the certified copy if requested by the applicant from the office where the previous application was filed.\n   \n    Option D 'File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau' would be redundant as the International Bureau typically works through the EPO for such requests.

Then, we add an additional four days (to cover the extra nine days as per Rule 126(2) EPC), resulting in the last day being 12 January 2025.\n\n    Option A is incorrect because it extends the deadline by one more day than necessary.\n    Option C is incorrect because it adds two additional days beyond what is required based on the late receipt of the document.\n    Option D is incorrect as it overestimates the deadline by three days.\n\nSources:\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

This implies that the use of such a contingency service would be recommended when there is a system outage at the EPO preventing document submission via standard means (option C). \n\nOption A ('When you submit documents after business hours') is incorrect because the EPO Contingency Upload Service is not specifically mentioned as a solution for late submissions.\n\nOption B ('When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end') is also incorrect. The service is meant to be used in situations where there's an outage or when standard services cannot be used due to system issues, not because of personal technical problems.\n\nOption D ('When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday') is irrelevant as the service is designed for use during operational hours and in specific system-related contingencies rather than office closures.\n\n\nSources:\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "Option C is correct according to the provided legal text because it states that if an applicant files a European patent application in a language other than one of the official languages of the EPO, they must provide a translation into any official language of the EPO within four months (Rule 71(3) EPC). In this scenario, Korhonen filed his application in Finnish and provided an English translation in time. When amending claims, he is allowed to file them in the language of the application as long as he provides a translation into any official language of the EPO, such as English, within the specified period (Rule 71(3) EPC). \n\nOption A is incorrect because it suggests that Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish and then provide a translation into English. This would not be allowed since he can choose to file the amended claims in any official language of the EPO, as long as they are accompanied by a translation within four months.\n\nOption B is partially correct but misleading because it does not specify that Korhonen must provide a translation into an official language of the EPO. Therefore, option C better reflects the legal text since it requires filing a translation in any of the official languages of the EPO (in this case, English).\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests that Korhonen cannot file the amended claims in Finnish at all. The legal context allows for the possibility of amending claims in the language of the application as long as they are accompanied by an appropriate translation.\n\nSources:\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

According to G-VIII, 12.4, 'PCT Direct is available for a single-language application, i.e., where either (a) all national applications under Rule 35(1)(a) EPC were filed with the Receiving Office in the same language or (b) the international application was filed at the EPO and the search opinion was established by the International Searching Authority (ISA). In option B, although both the priority application and the subsequent international application are related to an EP application, they are not filed in the same language, which disqualifies PCT Direct. \n\nOption A is correct because a PCT Direct letter can be used for a Belgian application in French that has been searched by the EPO, as long as the international application is also filed in French.\n\nOption C is correct since it meets the criteria of a single-language application where both the priority and subsequent applications are filed with the same language (English).\n\nOption D is correct because filing amended claims with a PCT Direct letter is a requirement for its utilization.\n\nSources:\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

Therefore, Mr Linguist can provide a translation into Spanish (an official language of Spain) or another 23 official languages of other EU states that have signed the UPCA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the application was not originally filed in Dutch but used it as the language of proceedings; thus, there is no obligation to translate back into Dutch.\nOption B is incorrect because the unitary effect extends only to certain member states of the European Union and not necessarily all 18 or more states that have signed the UPCA. \nOption D can be correct depending on which state Mr Linguist aims for immediate registration in, but since the question asks for a general statement and considering Spanish is one of the official EU languages, Option C is a broader and correct answer.\n\nSources:\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
