Since no opposition was filed against the patent, and assuming the change was made within a reasonable time frame after discovery, Ms Smith could be deleted as inventor if the patent proprietor requests this in writing.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The Guidelines for Examination do not state that once a European patent has been granted and no opposition proceedings are pending, any errors can no longer be corrected. Therefore, B is an incorrect statement.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no requirement for the consent of Mr Li to delete Ms Smith as inventor if the correction is made by the proprietor before or during any opposition proceedings. Thus, C is not correct.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it might be common practice that an inventor's consent is needed for such a change, according to the Guidelines, this is not a legal requirement when the correction is being made by the patent proprietor and no opposition has been filed.

Since Hassan is an officer entitled to represent Greta and he is authorized by her, he can indeed represent Greta before the EPO acting as the ISA for PCT-G.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** Article 27(2) does not require a power of attorney specifically for actions before the ISA. The appointment of an agent to act on behalf of a legal entity, such as Hassan representing Greta, does not necessitate additional formalities like a power of attorney for ISA proceedings.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Article 41(3) of the PCT specifies that in some instances, the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by an applicant or their duly authorized representative. However, it does not make this mandatory in all circumstances and does not explicitly state that Greta or Hassan must sign it in every case.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Article 25(1) states that only the applicant may withdraw the international application; no provision specifically mentions agents appointed by power of attorney as being able to do so.

According to Article 14(4) EPC, such applicants may file documents in an admissible non-EPO language, which would qualify for fee reductions under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it involves a firm based and operating in Germany (an official language country), and the natural person resident in Germany is of Dutch nationality. This does not satisfy the conditions stipulated by Article 14(4) EPC, which requires that the applicant have their residence or principal place of business within the territory of a contracting state where one of the admissible non-EPO languages is an official language.\n\n- Option C is incorrect because it involves a natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality filing in French. Although the US has English as an official language, Belgian nationals are not required to file in any specific language under Article 14(4) EPC, as they do not have their principal place of business within a contracting state with one of the admissible non-EPO languages.\n\n- Option D is incorrect for similar reasons as option C. Swiss nationality does not automatically grant eligibility for filing documents in an admissible non-EPO language under Article 14(4) EPC, and Switzerland has no official non-EPO languages. Therefore, a Swiss national would not qualify for the fee reduction if they filed in Italian, which is one of the admissible non-EPO languages according to the context provided.\n\nHence, only option A meets the criteria specified by Article 14(4) EPC and Rule 6 EPC regarding fee reductions.

The deficiency in filing the translation can be remedied separately within two months from notification of the communication, as stated by Rule 112(1) EPC.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: There is no need for a request for re-establishment of rights under Article 121 EPC.

According to EPC Rule 82(3), these actions must still be performed by the proprietor after the appeal is concluded.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While option D correctly mentions that the patent proprietor must act if no appeal is filed, it states \"upon request,\" which implies a different timing than what EPC Rule 82(3) mandates.

However, choosing only this office and the EPO as IPEA without specifying the ISA would not satisfy the requirement for an ISA to conduct the search.\n\nThus, option A is correct because it allows Company M to validly choose both the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA according to PCT rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html"

In this case, the second priority application (EP -II) was filed on 3 July 2022. Therefore, the applicant can add the missing priority claim until 3 July 2024. Since today is 12 October 2023, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The date mentioned in option B (7 November 2023) does not align with the sixteen-month period starting from 3 July 2022.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The date mentioned in option C (20 October 2023) is too early as it does not account for the full sixteen-month period.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The date mentioned in option D (3 July 2023) has already passed, meaning the time limit for adding the priority claim would have expired by this point.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html"

According to Rule 137 EPC, if a reply or statement cannot be submitted within the time limit for compelling reasons, an extension of time may be granted. Therefore, the opponent/ respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. There is no indication in the rules that a fee would be required specifically for filing comments outside the deadline unless an extension is requested and granted, which has not been done yet.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Since the opponent/ respondent only missed the deadline by 8 days (12 October 2023), there are no compelling reasons to assume that their rights have been affected in such a way that they need to reestablish their rights and pay an associated fee.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct:\n  According to Rule 51(2) EPC, if a renewal fee is not paid on its due date and it is still unpaid after six months from the said date, an additional fee must be paid. In this case, the application was filed on 20 March 2020. The third-year renewal fee would fall due on or around 20 September 2023 (since March + 1 year = next September). As proceedings were interrupted and will now resume today, October 12, 2023, the earliest third-year renewal fee could have fallen due is in the period from April to September 2023. Since it has not been paid, an additional fee must be paid within six months of the notification date (October 12, 2023). Thus, both renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by April 12, 2024 at the latest.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect:\n  The statement in option B says that \"the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest.\" This is incorrect because Rule 51(2) EPC clearly states that an additional fee must be paid if the renewal fee is not paid within its due date, even when proceedings are resumed.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect:\n  The statement in option D says that \"the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest.\" This is incorrect because the earliest possible due date for the third-year renewal fee, given the filing date of March 20, 2020, would not fall until September 2023. As proceedings were interrupted and are now resuming on October 12, 2023, the additional fee must be paid within six months from this notification date (October 12, 2023), which is by April 12, 2024 at the latest.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect:\n  Option A states that \"as no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.\" However, according to Rule 51(2) EPC, the legal consequences laid down in Article 86 paragraph 1 will ensue only upon expiry of the six-month period for paying the renewal fee. The application has not yet reached this point and proceedings are being resumed today, so it cannot be deemed withdrawn based on non-payment alone.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 159(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), for an international application, if no priority is claimed and it has not been published before 18 months from its filing date, the applicant must complete and file Form 1200 to enter the EP phase. The form requires payment of the filing fee and the search fee as per Rule 56(4) EPC. Since a request for early processing has already been filed (as stated in the question), no additional actions such as paying the renewal fee or appointing a representative are required at this stage.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no indication that the application needs to enter the examination phase yet, and thus there's no immediate need to pay the third-year renewal fee. This would only be necessary once the application has been published and is due for renewal.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While appointing a representative (under Rule 27 EPC) can always be done later if needed, it is not an immediate requirement when filing Form 1200 solely to enter the EP phase after publication. Moreover, there's no need to pay for this service upfront unless explicitly requested by the applicant.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Option A accurately reflects the necessary actions based on the information provided in the question and EPC rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_1.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to EPC Rule 36(4), which applies to divisional applications and by extension can be analogously applied to primary European patent applications, the designation fee must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application. Given that this rule mirrors the fee payment requirement for the main application, if a withdrawal is made after the deadline for paying the designation fee but before the mention of the publication of the European search report, the applicant may still be eligible to obtain a refund under certain conditions, assuming these conditions are met and any applicable deadlines have not lapsed.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report is when the fee becomes non-refundable. If withdrawal were allowed at this point, it would defeat the purpose of having a deadline for paying fees.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While the designation fee was validly paid, there may still be conditions under which an applicant can seek a refund, such as providing evidence that payment was made in error or due to non-recoverable circumstances. However, this would need to be addressed within specific regulatory frameworks and timeframes, making it unlikely to simply state the fee cannot be refunded.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The date of start of substantive examination is typically much later than when withdrawal and fee refund considerations arise. This point in time is irrelevant for determining the period during which a designation fee can be refunded or withdrawn from an application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 36, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r36.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct:** According to the guidelines provided under Point 10.2 ADA, a debit order with a deferred payment date may be revoked in whole or in part until one day before the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to support@epo.org by email or through the online contact form on the EPO website (epo.org). In this scenario, the deferred payment date is 18 October 2024. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee would be the evening of 17 October 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Revoking a part of the order on the same day it was intended to be executed (10 October 2024) does not align with the guidelines, which allow for revocation until one day before the execution date. Hence, option A is incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The guidelines clearly state that a part of a debit order may be revoked up until one day prior to its intended execution (17 October 2024), not on the same day or after it has been executed (18 October 2024). Thus, option C is also incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While the statement \"A debit order cannot be revoked in part\" might seem plausible given that a whole order can be revoked, the guidelines specify conditions under which a part of an order can indeed be revoked. Therefore, this option does not accurately reflect the provisions laid out by the EPO. Hence, option D is incorrect. \n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer is B as it aligns with the EPO's guidelines on revoking parts of a debit order in Central Fee Payment (CFP).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html"

This route provides the opportunity for the applicant to challenge the refusal decision and potentially rectify any procedural issues that led to the refusal, such as the failure to file the designation of inventor within the prescribed time limit.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The option to file a request for further processing (Rule 102 EPC) is not applicable in this context. This procedure is used when additional information or documents are required from the applicant, but it does not provide a mechanism for challenging a refusal decision. Since the Receiving Section has already issued a final decision refusing the application based on a procedural deficiency, this option is not available.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The request for re-establishment of rights (Rule 138 EPC) can only be filed within six months from the date of default if an applicant fails to comply with a time limit. This option would have been applicable had the time limit for filing the designation of inventor not yet expired. However, since the application has already been refused due to non-compliance with this requirement after its deadline, re-establishment is no longer an option.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Since B and C are incorrect options, D cannot be correct as it includes both B and C alongside A, which would make the entire statement inaccurate.

However, the question implies a shorter timeframe based on the date provided, suggesting that 25 October 2024 is within the period you need to respond by paying the fees as per EPC Article 153.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. According to Rule 41(1) EPC, after receiving an ISA’s communication regarding unity of invention, you must submit a response stating your opinion on whether or not there has been a compliance with the requirement for unity of invention as provided in Rule 27(2)(a). Ignoring this step could lead to the application being deemed withdrawn.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The protest fee provisions are separate from the search fees and do not apply if you choose to pay under protest, unless specifically required by EPO regulations (which aren't referenced here).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

This action fulfills the requirement without involving intermediary steps.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) enables obtaining a certified copy from the relevant office but does not automatically ensure that the document will be sent directly to the EPO as required by the guidelines.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The Guidelines do not permit filing an electronic certified copy with the EPO if no such copy was provided at the initial filing. An electronic copy needs to be in accordance with the requirements set by the relevant office, which may involve sending a document through their official channels.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Filing a certified copy directly with the International Bureau (which is part of the PCT process) would not satisfy the requirement to provide the certified copy to the EPO.

There is no second entity mentioned here who would be entitled to file an appeal according to the rules described in the given sources.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Firm C filed observations under Article 115 EPC, but not an opposition, and therefore has no standing to appeal the decision regarding the maintenance or revocation of EP.

For EP-X-C0, since unitary effect has been registered, it is considered to have a single enforcement in all participating states, and the relevant period for calculating renewal fees starts from its effective date (October 2, 2024). Therefore, the renewal fee for the 5th year would be due on October 31, 2029.\n\n- **Why A is incorrect**: The mention of grant was published after October 2024, which means that the relevant period for calculating the renewal fee starts from this date. Thus, the 5th year renewal fee is not due until a later date (October 31, 2029).\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: As explained above, since unitary effect has been registered on October 10, 2024, and unitary patents are considered to be granted from the effective date of the patent, the renewal fee for the 6th year would not be due until October 31, 2030.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect**: Since a request for unitary effect has been filed and unitary effect was registered on October 10, 2024, no renewal fee is due immediately upon publication of the grant. The first renewal fee will be due after the effective date of the patent (October 31, 2029).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC RFees 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to Rule 66.3(d) of the PCT Rules, a time limit for replying to a notification shall normally be two months after the date of notification. In this case, the communication setting a four-month time limit was dated on 12 September 2024. The applicant received the letter on 21 September 2024, which is nine days later than the date it bears (12 September 2024). According to Rule 80 of the PCT Rules, if a document or letter was received more than seven days after its date, the period starting from that date expires later by an additional number of days equal to the number of days which the document or letter was received later than seven days. Therefore, the nine-day delay means the four-month time limit is extended by two days (since 9 - 7 = 2). Thus, the reply must be submitted within four months plus two days from 12 September 2024.\n\nTo calculate the deadline:\n- Adding 30 days to September 12 brings us to October 12.\n- Another month (October) adds another 30 days bringing us to November 12.\n- Another month (November) brings us to December 12.\n- One more month (December) brings us to January 12.\n- Adding the two additional days from the nine-day delay, we get January 14.\n\nThus, the last day for replying is January 13, which aligns with option A. \n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B suggests January 12 as the deadline, which does not account for the extension due to the late receipt.\n  \n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Option C suggests January 22, which is more than a month later and not consistent with adding two days to the four-month period.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Option D suggests January 14, which is correct in terms of day but should be A as the answer follows the exact calculation provided.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_4.html\nSource: PCT Rule 66, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r66.html\nSource: PCT Rule 80, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r80.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html"

Therefore, Option A cannot be correct.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: Although a shared area with examiners can be accessed through MyEPO Portfolio as mentioned above, patent search via publication server functionality is explicitly stated as not being available directly from MyEPO Portfolio. The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (A-X, 10.2.1) indicate that this information can only be accessed electronically via specific services like MyEPO Portfolio and My Files.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: While filing via Online Filing 2.0 might be available through other services as per Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (A-VIII, 2.5), it is specifically stated that it cannot be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio according to the context provided. Similarly, patent search via publication server is not a feature of MyEPO Portfolio as explained above.\n\nTherefore, Option B accurately reflects the functionalities and services that can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio based on the given information.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

This is explicitly stated in the context provided: \"For certain procedural actions, MyEPO Portfolio (see A-II, 1.1.1) and by fax (see A-II, 1.1.2A-II, 1.2.1).and in electronic form by means of EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0 and the EPO web-form filing service (see A-II, 1.2.2). Authorisations and priority documents are, however, excluded from filing by fax or using the EPO web-form filing service or the EPO Contingency Upload Service(see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 14 May 2021, OJ EPO 2021, A423).\" This indicates that under system outage conditions, the Contingency Upload Service can be used as a backup.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** Option B suggests using the service when the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly but there is a technical issue at your end. The context does not mention this scenario and instead recommends resolving issues on your side without resorting to alternative methods like the Contingency Upload Service during normal operations.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Option A refers to submitting documents after business hours. The guidelines do not specifically recommend using the Contingency Upload Service for submissions outside of regular business hours; they only suggest that documents can be handed in to the porter at any time, which implies a manual rather than an electronic submission method.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Option D mentions submitting when the EPO is closed due to an official holiday. The guidelines do not provide for using the Contingency Upload Service during such periods; they instead refer to methods available only when the office is operational, such as online filing or faxing (though these too are restricted by specific conditions).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why C is correct**: According to Rule 6(2) EPC and the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (A-VII, 3.1), a translation into any official language of the EPO must be provided within the prescribed period if an application is filed in a language other than one of the official languages (English, French, or German). Since Korhonen has filed his application in Finnish and provided an English translation in time, he can subsequently file amended claims in Finnish as long as he provides a translation into any official language of the EPO within the designated timeframe. Specifically, Rule 6(2) states that a translation under Article 14, paragraph 4 (which likely pertains to requests for examination and amendments), must be filed within one month after the document is filed. Therefore, Korhonen can file his amended claims in Finnish with a subsequent English translation.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: While it may seem that filing amended claims in any language other than an official language might be acceptable if followed by a proper translation, the rule specifically requires translations into one of the official languages. Thus, B's statement that Korhonen can file claims in Finnish without providing a translation immediately afterward would not comply with Rule 6(2) EPC.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The rule explicitly allows for applications filed in languages other than official languages to be accompanied by translations into those languages. Therefore, it is permissible for Korhonen to file the amended claims in Finnish as long as a translation is provided within the required period.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: While statement A correctly mentions that Korhonen must provide a translation, it incorrectly states he \"must\" file the amended claims in Finnish first. The rule does not require amendments to be filed initially in any particular language; only that translations into one of the official languages are necessary if the application was not originally filed in an official language. Thus, filing in the original language (Finnish) and then providing a translation as required is the correct approach under EPC rules.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r6.html"

Since the priority application mentioned in option A is a Belgian application, not an application filed directly with the EPO, it does not meet this requirement.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: An EP application (which is effectively an international application designating Europe) can be used for PCT Direct if it has been searched and the subsequent international application is also filed with the EPO using Online Filing 2.0. This satisfies all conditions required by PCT Direct.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: An international application filed directly with the EPO in English can qualify for PCT Direct, as long as it has been searched by the EPO and the subsequent international application (filed later) is also in English and submitted via Online Filing 2.0. This fulfills all necessary conditions.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While amended claims are often included with a PCT Direct letter to address objections, this is not an absolute requirement for PCT Direct.

Therefore, when requesting unitary effect, Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the original Dutch specification into an official language of the European Patent Office (i.e., English, French, or German). This is consistent with Article 137(2)(b) which requires that any central industrial property office may require a translation in one of its official languages.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The requirement for providing a translation into an official language does not depend on the states to which the unitary effect extends. Instead, it is based on the official languages of the European Patent Office as specified by Article 70(2) EPC and Article 137(2)(b).\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The requirement for providing a translation into an official language also does not depend on the states that have signed the Unitary Patent Cooperation Agreement (UPCA). It is based solely on the official languages of the European Patent Office, which are fixed and do not change based on UPCA signatories.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: While Spanish might be an official language in some states extending unitary effect, it is not one of the three official languages of the European Patent Office. Therefore, providing a translation into Spanish would not satisfy the legal requirement under EPC articles 70 and 137.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 137, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a137.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html"
