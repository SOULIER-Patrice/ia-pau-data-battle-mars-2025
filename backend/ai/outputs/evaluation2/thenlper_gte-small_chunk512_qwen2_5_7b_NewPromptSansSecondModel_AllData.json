                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: Article 102(3) EPC states that a communication by the European Patent Office (EPO) is deemed to be delivered on the day following the date of posting, unless another date is specified. Therefore, if the communication was dated 7 December 2022 and a time limit of four months is set, it would be deemed delivered on 8 December 2022.\n\n- Explanation of why B is correct: A period of four months from 8 December 2022 would expire on 7 April 2023. Adding one day (17 April 2023) due to the delivery date means the time limit for replying indeed expires on 17 April 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why D is correct: According to Article 116(4) EPC, a request for extension can be validly filed before the deadline (14 days prior). Thus, an extension could be requested until 3 April 2023, which is four months and 14 days after the delivery date.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Further processing for replying to the communication can be validly requested under Article 116(5) EPC only within the extended time limit, not beyond it. If no extension has been granted (as in this case where a four-month period was set), the request must be filed by 3 April 2023 at the latest. Therefore, requesting further processing on 19 June 2023 is not correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_9.html"

This means that you need to file it and pay the late furnishing fee.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While the application might face consequences for not complying, it is not immediately deemed withdrawn if the applicant does not respond to the EPO's invitation in due time; there is a grace period where action can be taken to meet the requirements.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The sequence listing must be filed in electronic form and comply with the applicable WIPO standard. It should not be submitted as a PDF, but rather in the format specified by WIPO standards.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Even if the amino acid sequence is only used in an example and not claimed, it still needs to be disclosed in a manner that can support the description and claims.

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct. According to Article 23(2) PCT, an early entry into the European phase must be accompanied by the payment of the designation fee and any fees required for filing a patent application in each designated state. However, since no further processing or examination has been initiated yet (as it's only requesting early entry), the minimum requirement is just the filing fee.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. While claims fees are necessary for the actual examination process that follows, they are not required at this stage when merely requesting early entry into the European phase.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Renewal fees are relevant after the application has been examined and published in a particular European country, which is not applicable during the early entry stage. Additionally, filing fees cover the necessary documentation for early entry and do not require extra payment for claims or examination fees at this juncture.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Similar to option C, while designation and examination fees are important, they are not required for requesting early entry into the European phase. The focus here is solely on the initial filing fee to proceed with the early entry process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 71(3) EPC, a European patent application can be effectively withdrawn by paying the fee for grant and publishing and filing translations of the claims in the two other official languages of the EPO. The date of receipt of this communication marks the last point in time for an effective withdrawal.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: This option refers to the publication of the European patent application, which does not pertain to the withdrawal process but rather to the granting and publication stage.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: This option relates to the date of grant publication, after which the possibility of withdrawing a patent application ceases.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: This option suggests a day before the grant publication, but according to Rule 71(3), the exact moment for withdrawal is defined by the communication and actions mentioned, not a day prior.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct. This error can be corrected but not during the opposition period or if opposition proceedings are pending because any corrections to the published specification need to ensure that the patent's protection does not expand beyond what was agreed upon with all interested parties (including potential opponents). If oppositions are filed, these might base their arguments on the original correct content of the patent.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. While errors can be corrected at any time in principle, they cannot be done during or after opposition proceedings as this would undermine the fairness and certainty that oppositions rely upon.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The error can indeed be corrected but only outside the period when oppositions could reasonably base their arguments on it.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Opposition proceedings are not a prerequisite for making corrections; they merely affect the timing due to potential reliance by opponents on correct information. Corrections can still occur without opposition proceedings pending, as long as they do not prejudice the existing opposition rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to the guidelines, if you notice that pages 3 of the description and claims 7-12 are missing in EP-A after filing on 27 October 2022, you can file these missing parts at any time before they become part of the state of the art. The application will not be re-dated based on the submission of new pages. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The EPO does not typically issue a formal invitation to provide missing documents within a specific timeframe unless there are formal defects or non-compliance issues that require correction, which may result in additional fees and potential delays in examination.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: You cannot add claims 7-12 at any time if they were originally part of the description but not included. Each application must be filed with a complete set of claims, and adding claims without paying the required fees would likely involve additional costs and may affect the priority date or filing date.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While withdrawing EP-A and refile it can sometimes be an option to correct missing parts, it might not always be the best solution. It involves more administrative work and potential delays in the examination process compared to simply submitting the missing pages within a timely manner as per option B.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html"

There is no need for consent from the erroneously designated inventor (Ms Smith in this case). Therefore, Ms Smith will be deleted as inventor if the patent proprietor requests this in writing.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Rule 143(2) allows for the correction or deletion of information regarding inventors even when there are no proceedings pending before the EPO. Thus, it is not true that Ms Smith cannot be removed because no opposition was filed.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While it might seem reasonable to require consent from the inventor (Ms Smith) in some scenarios, Rule 143(2) specifically states that a patent proprietor can request deletion without needing the consent of the erroneously designated inventor. Therefore, Mr Li’s consent is not required.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to C, this option incorrectly implies that consent from Ms Smith (the erroneously designated inventor) is necessary for her name to be deleted. Rule 143(2) does not require such consent in the context described.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html"

While submitting a power of attorney (power of attorney) would typically be necessary for Hassan to act on behalf of Greta in other contexts, Article 28(1) of the PCT does not explicitly require a signed power of attorney for representation before the International Searching Authority.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The provisions of the PCT do not make it mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination be signed by either Greta or Hassan. According to Rule 53(1) of the PCT, an authorized person can submit the demand, which could include a representative even without direct signature from the applicant.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. While typically an application can only be withdrawn by the applicant or someone duly authorized in writing, Article 28(4) of the PCT allows for withdrawal to be carried out by anyone who has signed and filed the demand for international preliminary examination, which does not necessarily require a power of attorney from the original applicant.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

In this case, a Spanish European patent attorney files a European patent application in Spanish for a natural person who is resident in Andorra and of Andorran nationality. While the attorney's nationality (Spanish) does not match the applicant's country of residence or nationality (Andorra), the fact that an attorney from a European member state is representing the applicant could potentially qualify for a fee reduction under specific conditions, such as those outlined on Form 1001.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The German firm and the natural person filing jointly in Dutch do not meet the criteria specified by Rule 6 EPC. There is no indication that they are residents or nationals from countries with entitlement to a fee reduction, nor any mention of being represented by an attorney from a qualifying country.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The natural person resident and national of the USA would not be eligible for a filing fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC. This rule primarily benefits applicants who are residents or nationals of countries that have entered into agreements with the European Patent Office (EPO) allowing such entitlements, which typically do not include non-EU countries like the USA.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to option C, a natural person resident and national of the USA would also be ineligible for filing fee reductions under Rule 6 EPC.

Therefore, if the filing date was 16 November 2020, the fourth-year renewal fee would be due on 16 November 2023.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it suggests a due date that is one day later than the correct date.\n- Option C and D are incorrect as they suggest paying separately in each state where the patent is validated. Since your application is unitary, renewal fees must be paid centrally to the EPO according to Article 137(2) EPC.\n\nThus, the correct statement is A: The renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid centrally to the EPO. The due date is 16 November 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why D is correct:\n  According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if no appeal is filed and a European patent is maintained in amended form, the patent proprietor must, upon request, pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims, and file a typed version of the amended paragraph within four months. This requirement ensures that the document published reflects the final amendments accepted by the opposition division.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect:\n  The statement in option B is not accurate because if no appeal is filed, the patent proprietor will be required to pay the fee for publishing a new specification and submit the formally compliant documents, as per EPO procedures. This requirement does not depend on whether an appeal is pending or not.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect:\n  The interlocutory decision issued by the opposition division, in cases where no appeal has been filed, typically notes that the patent can be maintained based on the amended text and does not include a request for additional documents such as translations of the claims. Instead, these formalities must be addressed separately if requested.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect:\n  The statement in option A incorrectly suggests that a fee needs to be paid upon request for publishing a new specification, filing translations of the claims, and filing a typed version of the amended paragraph. These actions are typically required by the EPO, not just on request, when a patent is maintained in amended form without an appeal.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_2.html"

The choice depends on which entity the applicant has approached or designated during the PCT application process to conduct the search and examination.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Similarly, the Austrian Patent Office can be chosen for either role, but it cannot be combined with the EPO in this context since an ISA and IPEA must be selected from different entities under the PCT.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) can act as an ISA or IPEA, but it cannot be paired with the EPO for both roles. \n\nThus, option A is the correct choice given that the applicant has already selected the EPO as the ISA and can proceed to choose the USPTO as the IPEA if desired.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

Thus, option A is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The time limit for adding the priority claim does not extend to 7 November 2023 because that date falls outside the 12-month period from June 20, 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The time limit for adding the priority claim has already expired by October 12, 2023.

This would be required later when the application enters the national phases or when the European patent is granted but not yet published (Article 81(2) PCT and Rule 74 EPC).\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Appointment of a representative is not mandatory for entry into the EP phase as per Article 36(1) EPC, although it can be done.

However, in this specific case, since the applicant notices that the renewal fee is not yet due and should not be debited on the evening of 10 October 2024, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee would still allow the applicant to contact Central Fee Payment (CFP) before the debit order is executed on 18 October 2024. Therefore, the applicant can revoke the part of the order pertaining to the renewal fee at any point up until the execution date unless CFP has already processed it.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The option \"17 October 2024\" is too late because by this time, the debit order could have already been processed if not revoked earlier. \n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The option \"18 October 2024\" would be too late as the execution date has passed, and any revocation must occur before the order is executed.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it is true that a full debit order cannot be revoked in part according to A-X, 6.2.1, this scenario allows for specific parts of the order (in this case, the renewal fee) to potentially be revoked if done promptly before execution.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

Therefore, option B is also valid.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is correct:** Under Article 122(1) EPC, the applicant can request re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor.

The focus here is on paying the additional search fee within the time limit specified.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: While there might be a specific deadline for responding or acting upon the communication (usually 2 months from receipt), the statement that you must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024 is not directly supported by the given guidelines. The exact timeframe can vary and depends on the EPO's communication.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Paying a protest fee under protest (meaning disagreeing with the ISA’s decision) is an option, but it does not automatically mean you need to pay two protest fees if you decide to proceed by paying the additional search fees. The protest process and related fees are separate from the initial response required.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to have complied with the requirement of unity of invention for the purposes of the ISA's report, but it does not automatically mean the application will be deemed withdrawn. The application can still proceed as if the unity requirement was met, and you may address the issue in subsequent steps such as the International Preliminary Examination (IPE).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

There is no indication that a separate fee is required before the unitary effect is registered.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: As per Rule 51(3), EPC, the renewal fee for EP-X-C0 should be due from the same date as its filing, which was on the same day (2 October 2024) that unitary effect was registered. Therefore, it would not be due in respect of a 6th year.\n\n- **Option D is incorrect**: Since unitary effect has been granted for EP-X-C0, renewal fees are still required and cannot be avoided.\n\n- Option B is correct because the registration of unitary effect means that the new identifier (EP -X-C0) now applies to the same patent.

Since an amendment to claim 2 directly addresses a problem identified by the opponent, it does not fall under such impermissible additions or improvements but rather aims to clarify the patent's scope as required.\n\nGiven that the grounds for opposition cover issues of novelty, inventive step, and clarity, all proposed amendments are within the permissible range.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-V, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_v_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html"

The termination of proceedings does not preclude the rights of third parties as long as their intervention was valid and within the terms set by the Office.\n\n- **B.

Additionally, since the application has already met certain conditions by paying the examination fee and responding to the search opinion, it will start examination as soon as possible without waiting further.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While an accelerated examination might seem desirable due to the PACE request, the fact that no priority claim was made means this application falls under a category where the EPO strives to issue the extended/partial European search report within six months from the filing date.

Since the payment was made late, under EPC Article 84(3), if a fee has not been paid by its due date, it will be considered that no request for the service incurring the fee has been made. This means the international application could potentially be considered to have been withdrawn.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The Guidelines do not state that late fees can be accepted as if they were paid within the one-month period; rather, they would need to be treated as untimely payments and may result in the application being considered withdrawn or subject to penalties.\n  \n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** While there are mechanisms for crediting fees under certain circumstances (as detailed in A-X, 5.1.1), there is no indication that a late fee will be charged at 50% of the fees due. The focus would likely be on the application being considered withdrawn rather than imposing additional late payment penalties.\n  \n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** There is no specific mention in the provided guidelines about an invitation to pay a late payment fee of 50% of the fees due; hence, this option is not supported by the available information.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 11.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_11_4.html"

Therefore, only the filing fee needs to be paid.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The examination fee is not necessary for early entry if the application has been filed within 24 to 30 months from the priority date (assuming no priority claim).\n\n- **Explanation of why C and D are incorrect:** Since there is no delay in filing the application beyond 24 months, the renewal fee is not applicable. Additionally, the claims fee is only required when claims are added or changed, which is not specified in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: The filing fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 13.5 EPC, a request for restoration of priority must be filed within one month from the expiry of the time limit for claiming priority (in this case, 31 months from the filing date of the priority right). This ensures that the request is timely and adheres to the procedural requirements set forth by the European Patent Office.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While Rule 159(1) EPC outlines various conditions for claiming restoration, it does not specify a timeline for requesting restoration after entering the regional phase. Therefore, this option does not align with the specific requirement mentioned in A.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Similar to B, Rule 159(1) EPC does not set a two-month limit for filing a request for restoration. The one-month period from the expiry of the time limit (31 months) is the correct timeframe as per Rule 13.5 EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: This option incorrectly references the international application's filing date, which is irrelevant to the priority restoration procedure at the EPO regional phase. The relevant timeline starts from the expiry of the time limit for claiming priority (31 months) and not from the filing date of the international application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to the guidelines provided under A-VII, 1.4 and A-II, 5.4.4, a translation into one of the official EPO languages (English, French, or German) is required within two months of the end of the 31-month period for entering the EPO regional phase if the priority application is in another language. This is necessary to ensure that the European patent application can be properly processed and examined.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The requirement is specifically for a translation into one of the official languages, not necessarily the language of the proceedings as defined by Rule 3(2).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no exception stated in the guidelines that allows for no translation to be required unless the validity of the priority claim is relevant to patentability. A translation must always be provided.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While a declaration can be submitted indicating that the European application is a complete translation of the priority document, this does not relieve the requirement to provide an official language translation within the specified timeframe.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4_4.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.4, where the translation is not filed in due time, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency within a non-extendable period of two months. If the translation is not filed in time in response to this invitation, the application may be deemed withdrawn under Art. 14(2). However, if the applicant files the translation and requests further processing under Rule 135 EPC within two months of notification by the EPO, the application can continue with further processing. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The applicant cannot request reinstatement of rights under Rule 49.6 PCT as this rule pertains to cases where an international application has not been filed or is incomplete in a receiving Office and does not apply directly to the situation where a translation is overdue at the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why other options are not provided: There are no additional options (C and D) given in the question, thus they cannot be addressed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html"

The applicants based in Japan can themselves comply with this requirement as they are considered individuals resident in a state party to the PCT, which grants them the right to file directly.\n\n- Option A and B are incorrect because there is no general obligation under Rule 159(1) EPC for an applicant to appoint a professional representative or legal representative. The rule simply requires that one of the applicants be entitled to file, and individuals can typically fulfill this requirement without needing additional representation.\n\n- Therefore, option C is correct as it accurately states that the applicants themselves can comply with Rule 159(1) EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: PCT Rule 18, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r18.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: PCT Rule 26, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r26.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: Under the Paris Convention, an applicant can claim priority from an earlier-filed application within 12 months. Since FP2 was filed ten months after FP1 and claims subject-matter A which is identical to FP1, it is valid to claim both priorities. Therefore, EP1 can be granted with both claims 1 and 2 if no new prior art is discovered.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While the priority from FP2 is valid as explained above, FP1 cannot provide a valid priority claim for subject-matter A+B since it does not disclose or relate to this additional matter. Thus, EP1 can only be granted with the claim related to subject-matter A and not claim 2.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: As per the reasoning provided in B, EP1 cannot validly claim priority from FP1 for subject-matter A+B, but it can still make a valid priority claim from FP2 for subject-matter A. Therefore, claim 1 will be granted and the issue with FP1 only affects additional claims.\n\n- No option D is provided; hence, there's no need to explain its incorrectness.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_3.html"
