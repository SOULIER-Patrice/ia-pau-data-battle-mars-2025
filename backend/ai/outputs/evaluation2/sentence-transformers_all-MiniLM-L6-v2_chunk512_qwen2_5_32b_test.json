The time limit for paying the designation fee (option A) falls under these circumstances where the request for re-establishment of rights is possible.\n\n- **Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect:**\n  - **B:** Time limit for requesting examination cannot be remedied by a request for re-establishment of rights. The rules specifically do not provide for re-establishing rights in this case. Requesting examination under Art. 94(1) in conjunction with Rule 70(1) is considered an independent procedural act and not subject to the re-establishment provisions.\n  - **C:** Time limit for filing the application within the priority period (priority claim time limit) cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights. According to Article 87, if the application was not filed within the required timeframe from the original filing date, the priority is lost and there are no mechanisms provided in the rules for reinstatement.\n  - **D:** Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself is a prerequisite for initiating the re-establishment process. If this time limit is missed, it implies that the applicant has not even initiated the request to re-establish their rights, hence this option does not make sense within the context provided.\n\nThus, only the time limit for paying the designation fee can be remedied through requesting re-establishment of rights as per the applicable EPO regulations."

The person in option C is a natural person resident in the USA (a non-contracting state) but holds Belgian nationality (a contracting state). This satisfies the criteria for entitlement under Rule 6 EPC.\n  \n- Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect.\n  - Option A: Though the applicant here is from Andorra, which would generally qualify as an individual applicant resident outside the European Union, crossing the box on Form 1001 alone does not suffice if there’s any uncertainty or additional requirements that might disqualify this scenario. Additionally, filing in Spanish by a patent attorney doesn't necessarily mean entitlement to reduced fees under Rule 6 EPC.\n  \n  - Option B: This option involves two applicants (a firm and an individual) jointly filing the application, which means they do not qualify for any fee reduction as per Rule 6 EPC. The criteria for reduced fees require that only one natural person who is resident in a non-contracting state can make such a declaration.\n  \n  - Option D: This option involves an applicant from the USA but of Swiss nationality. While the individual meets the condition of being resident outside a contracting state and holding nationality of one, filing the application in Italian (a language not aligned with their nationality or place of residence) might lead to additional scrutiny that could disqualify them under Rule 6 EPC’s criteria for reduced fees."

After grant, these fees should be paid directly to national offices in the chosen validation states. Option B has the correct due date (30 November 2023), but it also incorrectly suggests central payment through the EPO.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While D correctly identifies that the renewal fee must be paid separately to each state and mentions the grace period, its last date for valid payment without an additional fee (16 January 2024) is incorrect.

As Form 1200 was used without any further amendments upon entry into the European regional phase, a communication under Rules 161/162 will be received that states if there is no reply in time, the application will be deemed to be withdrawn (Form 1226AA). This form informs the applicant of the potential consequences and requires action within a given timeframe.\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Form 1226BB typically offers an opportunity to comment and file amendments but would not be issued in this scenario because there are no further actions needed if the earlier amendments (under Article 19 PCT) have already been accepted and are part of the application.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Form 1226CC offers the opportunity to file amendments before the supplementary European search report is drawn up, but it would not be issued since no further amendments were filed upon entry into the regional phase, and the earlier amendments are already considered part of the application.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Form 1226AC states that examination has started.

The renewal fee is not required at this stage because it would be due after thirty-one months from the filing date.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Option B incorrectly includes paying the renewal fee for the third year, which is not necessary within 25 months of the filing date. According to Rule 159(1)(g), the third-year renewal fee only needs to be paid if it has fallen due earlier under Rule 51(1).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Option C includes appointing a representative, which is not mandatory for entering the EP phase as per Rule 159.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. None of the above statements correctly identifies the necessary actions if option A (the correct answer) applies."

According to Rule 39(2) EPC as mentioned in the case law reference provided (Case Law IV, A.7.2.1), the designation fee must be paid within six months from the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. If the applicant withdraws before this deadline and the designation fee has not been paid, the application will be deemed to be withdrawn under Rule 39(2) EPC without incurring a penalty for non-payment, hence allowing a refund.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The date of mention of the publication of the European search report is the starting point from which the six-month period begins but not the deadline itself. Hence, withdrawing on or before that date would still require paying the designation fee within the subsequent six months to avoid deemed withdrawal.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The designation fee can indeed be refunded if the application is withdrawn before it is paid and before the end of the stipulated time frame (six months from publication mention).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The start of substantive examination does not pertain to the deadline for payment or deemed withdrawal related to the designation fee under Rule 39(2) EPC. The relevant time limit pertains to the six-month period post-publication mention in the European Patent Bulletin."

Here, the execution date for the debit order is set for 18 October 2024; thus, the latest point in time to revoke part of the order (such as the renewal fee) would be 17 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why A, C, and D are incorrect.\n    - **A.** 10 October 2024: This date is too early for a partial revocation since the full debit order was just filed that day, and no delay in processing would have occurred by this time. The applicant still has up until one day before the execution date to revoke part of the order.\n    - **C.** 18 October 2024: This is incorrect as it is the actual date when the debit order will be executed. According to ADA Section 13.2, a partial revocation can only be made until one day before the execution date (i.e., 17 October 2024).\n    - **D.** A debit order cannot be revoked in part: This statement is incorrect as per ADA Section 13.2, which explicitly states that a debit order with a deferred payment can indeed be revoked in whole or in part until the day before execution."

When an applicant fails to meet a deadline and their European patent application is refused as a consequence (such as under Article 90(3) EPC and Rule 60 EPC), the appropriate course of action is to file a notice of appeal within four months from the notification of the refusal decision (see Article 108 EPC). This allows the applicant to challenge the refusal on the grounds that it was improperly issued.\n\n- Explanation of why B, C, and D are incorrect.  \n    - Option B suggests filing a request for further processing, which is not applicable in this scenario as there's no provision under the EPC for requesting further processing when an application has already been refused.\n    - Option C involves filing a request for re-establishment of rights (Article 122 EPC). However, Article 122(4) explicitly states that re-establishment of rights is ruled out in respect to the time limit for requesting such re-establishment. Therefore, once the deadline has passed and the refusal decision has been issued, a request for re-establishment will not be effective.\n    - Option D suggests all options A, B, and C are correct, but since B and C are incorrect as explained above, this option is also incorrect."

This ensures that these observations are comprehensible and can be considered by the examining division during their examination process.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it is true that third-party observations must be filed in writing, they may actually be filed anonymously according to Art. 115 of the EPC and Rule 114(1). This means that there is no requirement for them to be non-anonymous.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Third-party observations do not require an official fee to be paid; filing these observations is free of charge under the EPO rules. Additionally, while a statement of the grounds on which they are based is useful and often expected, it is not explicitly required for them to be considered by the examining division.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The person that files third-party observations will not become a party to the proceedings before the EPO. They do not have any procedural rights in these proceedings, nor is the applicant obliged to respond directly to these observations; rather, it is up to the examining division to consider them and possibly take action accordingly."

Here, the communication was dated 25 September 2024, so the deadline for payment would be 25 November 2024 (not 25 October as stated in option A), but the principle remains correct that additional search fees must be paid within two months.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The applicant is required to file a response if they wish to address any issues identified in the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. Ignoring this communication could result in adverse consequences, such as examination proceeding without addressing these issues adequately.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: According to EPC Rule 64(1), if additional fees are paid under protest, a single protest fee should be paid for all the additional search fees being contested, not one per each additional fee. Thus, paying two separate protest fees would not comply with the correct procedure.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If no additional search fees are paid within the time limit, only those inventions that were initially searched will continue to be examined. The application as a whole will not be deemed withdrawn; instead, it may proceed for examination in relation to the invention(s) covered by the initial search fee."

Opponents do not appeal revocation decisions but rather seek to uphold such decisions or withdraw their objections if they are satisfied.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Third parties who only file observations under Art. 115 EPC (such as Firm C) cannot initiate appeals. They are not considered formal opponents and thus lack standing in the appeal proceedings.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

Renewal fees are due only after registration and starting from the date of grant.

However, since the language of the proceedings is English and the EPO requires that all documents are understandable by its officials who work primarily with the three official languages (English, French, German), Korhonen must provide a translation into English within a non-extendable period as per Rule 165(2).\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Although Korhonen can file amended claims in Finnish and should then provide a translation into an official language of the EPO, the translation specifically needs to be into English according to the context provided (the proceedings are conducted primarily in English given that the initial application was translated into English). Providing a translation into any other official language would not suffice based on the specific context.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. While Korhonen can file amended claims in Finnish, there is no requirement for him to provide an additional translation if he already provided one at the time of filing his initial application. Rule 165(2) requires that any amendments must be understood by the EPO officials and thus need a proper English translation, but this does not mean Korhonen must first file in Finnish and then separately translate; he can provide it directly or ensure a timely translation is submitted.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. Korhonen is allowed to file amended claims in Finnish because Rule 70(1) permits the filing in the language of the application if it’s an official language of one of the contracting states, which Finnish is.
