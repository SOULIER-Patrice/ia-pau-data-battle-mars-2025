Since no proceedings are pending before the EPO at this stage (as no opposition was filed), the patent proprietor has the right to correct such mistakes in inventorship by informing the EPO.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The fact that no opposition has been filed does not prevent the patent proprietor from correcting errors like inventors' names. Hence, statement B is incorrect as it suggests Ms Smith cannot be deleted because of the lack of pending proceedings.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: EPC Rule 78(1) does not require consent from another party to correct inventorship; the correction can be made by the patent proprietor alone through a written request. Therefore, statement C is incorrect as it implies Mr Li's consent is needed for deleting Ms Smith’s name.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Similar to option B and C, this statement incorrectly suggests that no corrections can be made without the inventor's consent, which contradicts EPC Rule 78(1).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_3_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 78, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r78.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 13, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_13.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_2_1.html"

The natural person resident and a national of Andorra (a state with Spanish as an official language) can file documents in Spanish, which is not one of the official languages at the European Patent Office (EPO), i.e., English, French, or German. Therefore, under Article 14(4) EPC, a translation into an official EPO language must be filed, and the applicant would be eligible for fee reductions as mentioned in Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option B**: This option does not fit within the provisions of Article 14(4) EPC. The natural person is resident in Germany (an EPO member state with German as an official language), so there is no need to file documents in a non-official language and translation into another official EPO language would be required, which does not entitle them to the fee reductions under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option C**: This option does not fit within Article 14(4) EPC either. The applicant is resident in the USA (an English-speaking country), so there is no need for a filing in a non-official language and therefore, they are not eligible for the fee reductions under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option D**: Similar to option C, the Swiss national can file documents in Italian without needing translation into an official EPO language as Switzerland’s language (Italian) is recognized as one of the official languages.

The due date for the renewal fee can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest (which corresponds to the beginning of the fourth patent year).

This invitation typically comes together with the interlocutory decision.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: While it mentions paying fees and filing translations, these are not necessarily required upon receipt of the invitation; they may be required only if a publication or translation is necessary due to the specific amendments made.

Therefore, choosing the Austrian Patent Office as ISA with EPO as IPEA is not a valid option.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to option B, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore cannot be chosen as both ISA and IPEA for the same application; it can only serve one role or another.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 52(3) EPC, an applicant may correct a declaration of priority within 'sixteen months from the earliest priority date claimed, or, where the correction would cause a change in the earliest priority date claimed, within sixteen months from the correct earliest priority date, whichever sixteen-month period expires first'. In this case, the latest priority date is 3 July 2022. Therefore, the time limit for adding the missing priority claim would be until 7 January 2024 (16 months from 3 July 2022). Since today is 12 October 2023, the deadline to add the priority claim is on 3 November 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The time limit for adding the missing priority claim does not extend beyond the six-month period from when the applicant discovers the error. Therefore, it cannot be until 7 November 2023.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The time limit to add a valid priority claim starts counting from the date of filing the earlier application, in this case, 7 July 2022. Thus, the correct deadline would not be on 20 October 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Although the applicant discovered the missing priority claim on 12 October 2023, the time limit for adding a valid priority claim starts from when the application was originally filed, which is 7 July 2022. Therefore, the deadline to add the missing priority claim expired on 3 January 2024 (six months after 7 July 2022), not on 3 July 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to the rules for appeals before the European Patent Office, a respondent has a certain period to file comments. In this case, the opponent/respondent was given four months from 1 June 2023 to file their comments. Since today is 12 October 2023, which falls outside the initially granted period of four months, the opponent/respondent needs to request an extension of the period for filing their comments.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: There is no requirement or indication in the case that the opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing. The rules do not automatically require such payment just because the deadline has passed without prior request for an extension.\n  \n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: There is no need to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and associated fee, as this would be necessary only in cases where there are specific grounds for delay due to circumstances beyond control (such as natural disasters or illness), which is not the situation here.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Since option A provides the correct action that needs to be taken, none of the other options fit.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 79, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r79.html\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_4_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.6.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_6_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html"

                    "Justification": "- The application was filed on 20 March 2020. According to Rule 51(1), renewal fees for the third and fourth years would fall due on 31 July 2021 (for the third year) and 30 April 2022 (for the fourth year).\n\n- Proceedings were interrupted under EPC Rule 142 on 10 March 2022. Under Rule 51(4), if a European patent application has been refused or deemed to be withdrawn as a result of non-observance of a time limit, and if the applicant's rights are re-established, renewal fees due within four months from that latter date may still be paid without an additional fee. The applicant’s rights would have been re-established on 12 October 2023 when proceedings were resumed.\n\n- Therefore, as per Rule 51(4)(a), the third-year renewal fee (which fell due by 31 July 2021) and any renewal fees due within four months of filing the divisional application may be paid without an additional fee until 12 October 2023. The fourth-year renewal fee which would have fallen due in April 2022 could also fall under this provision as it is less than four months from 12 October 2023.\n\n- Consequently, the renewal fees for both third and fourth years can be paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 (6 months after proceedings were resumed), but without any additional fee by 31 October 2023. Hence, option C is correct.\n\n**Explanation of why B, D are incorrect:**\n\n- Option B states that the renewal fees can be paid on 12 October 2023 at the latest without an additional fee, which contradicts Rule 51(2) requiring an additional fee if not paid by the due date.\n  \n- Option D suggests payment until 31 October 2023, but this period is incorrect because renewal fees can only be paid for a maximum of four months from proceedings resumption. \n\n**Explanation of why A is incorrect:**\n\n- Option A states that as no renewal fees have been paid, the application would be deemed withdrawn, which does not align with Rule 51(4) allowing payment without an additional fee within four months after re-establishment of rights.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

Since no priority has been claimed and the application has not exceeded 50 pages or more than 30 claims, there is no need to pay a renewal fee for the third year at this stage.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While appointing a representative might be advisable in some cases, it is not a mandatory step as specified by the European Patent Office rules under the circumstances described (no priority claimed and application within size limits).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to EPC Rule 36(4), the designation fee for a divisional application must be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the search report. This period defines the timeframe during which the applicant can seek a refund if they wish to withdraw the application. If the applicant decides to withdraw the application after this deadline, no refund will be available because the designation fee becomes validly paid and irrevocable.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report is when the search has been completed and the report published. This does not provide a timeframe for withdrawing the application or requesting a refund of fees, particularly the designation fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: While it's true that the designation fee was paid within the required time frame (within one month after filing), this option incorrectly states that the fee can no longer be refunded. According to EPC Rule 36(4), there is a specific period during which an applicant may withdraw their application and potentially obtain a refund of the designation fee, provided they do so before the end of six months from the mention in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The date of start of substantive examination refers to when the patent office begins detailed examination of the application. This stage occurs after the search report has been published and does not provide any information about the timeframes for withdrawing an application or requesting a refund of fees, including the designation fee. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A: Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report, as this period defines when the applicant must act to withdraw the application and possibly receive a refund of the designation fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 36, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r36.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct**: According to Point 10.2 ADA, a debit order may be revoked in whole or in part by sending a signed written notice to support@epo.org by email or through the online contact form on the EPO website (epo.org). The notice must be received by the EPO no later than one day before the intended execution date of the debit order. In this scenario, the intended execution date is 18 October 2024. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP) would be 17 October 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Revocation requires a notice sent by the applicant, and this must reach the EPO before the intended execution date. Therefore, simply noticing an issue on 10 October 2024 does not allow for immediate revocation; it must be done by 17 October 2024 to ensure the EPO processes the request in time.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The intended execution date specified in the debit order is 18 October 2024. Revoking an order on this day or after would mean that a significant part of the process (debiting the renewal fee) has already begun, which contradicts the requirement for timely revocation.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The option states that \"A debit order cannot be revoked in part,\" but according to Point 10.2 ADA, it clearly specifies that a partial revocation can occur as long as the notice is received by the EPO before the intended execution date. Therefore, this option misinterprets the rule and is incorrect. \n\nIn summary, B (17 October 2024) is the correct answer because it adheres to the requirement of timely revocation according to Point 10.2 ADA. The other options either do not meet the timing requirement or provide an inaccurate interpretation of the revocation process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html"

The time limit for filing such a notice of appeal is four months from the date of notification of the decision, as per Rule 97(1) EPC. Therefore, the applicant can file a notice of appeal within this period to challenge the refusal and potentially remedy the situation by addressing the deficiency noted in the communication.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** There is no provision for a \"request for further processing\" under Article 90 or Rule 60 EPC. The only mechanism provided for dealing with deficiencies identified before examination starts (such as the requirement to file a designation of inventor) and for challenging a refusal decision after it has been issued is through an appeal process.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** While a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of a time limit can be filed under Rule 137 EPC, this does not apply here. The deficiency noted (failure to file the designation of inventor) was identified after filing and resulted in a refusal decision; therefore, a request for re-establishment is not relevant.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Since B and C are incorrect as explained above, option D cannot be correct.

The time limit for responding is typically 2 months from the communication date, which in this case is 25 September 2024.

Additionally, submitting an electronic copy without a prior request might not comply with official procedures.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Filing a certified copy directly with the International Bureau (IB) would bypass the EPO's standard procedure and could lead to delays or complications in handling the application efficiently.

After the registration of unitary effect, any reference should use the combined application number (EP-X-C0).\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**:\n  The renewal fee for the 6th year would be due on 31 October 2025, not 31 October 2024. According to the schedule, it takes one year from the grant mention date (registration) before the first renewal fee becomes payable.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**:\n  The statement in option D is incorrect because a renewal fee must be paid even though unitary effect was registered on the same day as the mention of grant. The proprietor still needs to pay for the term that covers the date from which unitary protection begins, hence the need to pay the renewal fee by 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC RFees 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to Rule 126(2) EPC, if a document was delivered later than seven days after its date, the period starts from the day it was actually received. The applicant received the communication on 21 September 2024, which exceeds the initial seven-day period (from 12 September 2024). Therefore, the reply period starts 9 days after the receipt, i.e., 30 September 2024. Since the time limit is four months from the date of notification, it will expire on 30 January 2025. However, Rule 80(7) states that a period expires at the moment the relevant Office closes for business on the final day. Assuming standard business closure times (typically before midnight), the last working day is likely to be 13 January 2025.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B suggests 12 January 2025, which does not account for the extended period due to late receipt as per Rule 126(2) EPC and the standard business closure time.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Option C proposes 22 January 2025. This date exceeds the calculated four-month period from the actual receipt, which would place it after the normal expiration date based on the four-month term starting from 30 September 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Option D suggests 14 January 2025. Similar to B and C, this date also does not align with the period calculated based on the late receipt and standard business closure rules. The correct last day for replying would be before or at the end of the extended four-month period, which is most likely 13 January 2025 considering the typical business practices.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_4.html\nSource: PCT Rule 66, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r66.html\nSource: PCT Rule 80, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r80.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html"

This aligns with information found in the given legal documents, such as notices related to the features of MyEPO Portfolio.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because it mentions functionalities that are not directly accessible from MyEPO Portfolio, such as accessing the European Patent Register or using eOLF (Online Filing software) via MyEPO Portfolio. The context clearly states these are incorrect claims.\n\n- Option C is also incorrect as it includes a patent search via publication server which is not mentioned in any of the provided documents related to MyEPO Portfolio functionalities. While the Mailbox and shared area with examiners are correct, the patent search functionality does not fit within the scope of direct access from MyEPO Portfolio.\n\n- Option D includes filing via Online Filing 2.0, which according to the context is incorrect since it states that specific procedural actions can be filed using MyEPO Portfolio but not necessarily via Online Filing 2.0. Additionally, patent search via the publication server is also excluded from this option as it does not align with the functionalities provided by MyEPO Portfolio.\n\nTherefore, only Option B accurately reflects the functionalities or services that can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio based on the given information.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

This service is explicitly mentioned as an alternative method in scenarios where the primary systems are unavailable or unusable due to technical issues, such as outages.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The context does not suggest that the EPO Contingency Upload Service should be used when the EPO's own filing systems are functioning correctly but there is a technical issue at the user’s end. Instead, it suggests that for such cases, alternative methods like MyEPO Portfolio or by fax (with some limitations) may be more appropriate.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The context indicates that documents can be submitted outside of business hours through other means as well. For example, the filing offices in Munich's Isar building and The Hague have automated mailboxes which can be used outside office hours without needing to use the EPO Contingency Upload Service.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The context does not specify that using the EPO Contingency Upload Service is recommended when the EPO itself is closed due to official holidays. In such cases, it typically suggests waiting until the EPO reopens or considering other means of submission during office hours. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C because the EPO Contingency Upload Service is recommended specifically for situations where there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via standard systems.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why C is correct:** According to the legal context provided, under Art. 14(2) EPC and Rule 6(2) EPC, a European patent application must be filed in one of the official languages of the EPO (English, French, or German), or if not, it must be translated into one of these languages within a specified timeframe. In this scenario, Korhonen initially filed his application in Finnish and provided an English translation in time, which complies with the legal requirement. For responding to the Extended European Search Report (EESR) by filing amended claims, Art. 123 EPC allows for amendments that do not exceed the scope of the original disclosure but does not specify the language requirements beyond compliance with Article 5 PLT and Rule 6 EPC. Therefore, Korhonen is allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish and then provide a translation into any official language of the EPO, such as English, within the required timeframe.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While it might seem that filing the amended claims in another official language (other than English) could be permissible, the EPC rules explicitly require that translations be provided into one of the three official languages. Therefore, simply stating \"any official language\" without specifying which would not fully comply with the legal requirements.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** The correct answer does allow for Korhonen to file amended claims in Finnish if a translation is subsequently provided, as per Art. 14(2) EPC and Rule 6(2) EPC. Thus, stating that it is \"not allowed\" would be incorrect.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** While the statement in option A includes filing the amended claims in Finnish followed by a translation into English, it adds an unnecessary requirement that the original application must already have been filed in Finnish and translated into English, which is not necessarily required. The correct interpretation allows for the initial application to be filed in any language as long as a timely translation is provided according to Rule 6 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r6.html"

However, this does not apply to a situation where the initial Belgian application (priority application) is filed in a language that necessitates translation under Art. 153(5), in conjunction with Rule 165 of the EPC.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** This scenario aligns perfectly with the criteria for PCT Direct. The priority application is an EP application in French, and the international application is filed in English, which can be processed via Online Filing 2.0. Both languages are acceptable under the conditions specified by Rule 165.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** This scenario also fits within the criteria for PCT Direct. The initial international application with the EPO and subsequent international application being in English, filed using Online Filing 2.0, meet all requirements stated in the conditions for PCT Direct.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While amended claims must be included in a single PDF document as part of the PCT Direct letter, this requirement does not invalidate the option to use PCT Direct based on the language criteria. Therefore, it is a necessary procedural step but does not make other options incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct**: According to Article 70(3) EPC, \"Any Contracting State may provide that a translation into one of its official languages, as prescribed by it according to this Convention, shall in that State be regarded as authentic.\" This implies that for the purpose of obtaining unitary effect, Mr Linguist must ensure his application is translated into an official language of any state where the unitary effect is sought. Since the unitary patent system covers 18 states (as per the Unified Patent Court Agreement, UPCA), he must provide a translation in one of these states' official languages.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Mr Linguist filed his application in Dutch, but Dutch is not an official language of the European Patent Office. Therefore, providing a translation into Dutch would not comply with Article 70(3) EPC.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The UPCA covers only 18 states, and while Spanish might be an official language of some of these states (e.g., Spain), it is not mandatory for all 18. Thus, requiring a translation into the official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA would be overly broad.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: While Spanish might be an official language in some of the 18 states covered by the unitary effect, it is not a requirement. The specification must only be translated into one of the official languages of any state where the unitary effect is sought, as per Article 70(3) EPC. Therefore, providing a translation into Spanish would not meet the legal requirements for immediate registration of the unitary effect. \n\nIn summary, Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B). Options A, C, and D do not comply with the specified legal requirements. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Article 137, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a137.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html"
