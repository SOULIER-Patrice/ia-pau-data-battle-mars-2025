This means option A is correct because Ms Smith can indeed be deleted as an inventor if the patent proprietor requests this in writing.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no rule stating that a person cannot be removed from the list of inventors simply because no proceedings are pending before the EPO. The opportunity for correction exists even after grant, provided it adheres to the procedural requirements set by Rule 60.\n\nOption C is incorrect as per the legal context, which does not require Mr Li’s consent if he is not the rightful inventor and has been incorrectly designated. According to EPC practices, the removal of an inventor can be done without requiring their consent once discovered that they were wrongly included (as long as the patent proprietor requests it).\n\nOption D is also incorrect because Rule 60 does not require Ms Smith's consent for her name to be removed from the list of inventors. The authority to make such a change lies with the patent proprietor, provided there is evidence or acknowledgment that she was incorrectly designated.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html"

Hassan cannot represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority, as this role requires specific authority under national patent offices' rules and not just representation for filing.\\n\\n- **Why C is Incorrect**: Rule 20(1) of the PCT mandates that a power of attorney be filed by an authorized representative to act on behalf of the applicant. It does not explicitly state that Greta or Hassan must sign the demand for international preliminary examination, which could be handled through proper authorization.\\n\\n- **Why D is Incorrect**: Rule 64(2) of the PCT allows for withdrawal of an application only by the applicant or their authorized representative with a signed power of attorney. Therefore, it does not require that the applicant personally withdraw the application, but rather through a properly appointed agent like Hassan if he has been given the necessary authority.\\n\\nIn summary, option B is correct as stated, and options A, C, and D are incorrect based on the provided legal text.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

This aligns with the requirement that any amendments must be made in the language of the proceedings, which in this case is English as per the original application's filing language and subsequent divisional application.\n\n- **Option A:** The deficiency can indeed be remedied by providing a translation, making this option incorrect.\n  \n- **Option B:** While an English translation must be filed to remedy the situation, it should be done together with a request for further processing rather than just within two months of notification as stated in B. This makes B incorrect because it does not fully address the need for a formal request.\n\n- **Option D:** Re-establishment of rights is typically associated with situations where there has been an unintentional delay or failure to meet deadlines due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control, which is not applicable here given that Mr Van Holland can remedy the deficiency by simply providing the required translation.

Upon maintaining the patent in amended form, the patent proprietor will receive an invitation to pay the fee for publishing a new specification, file translations of the claims, and file a formally compliant version of the entire description or at least the paragraphs containing such amendments (option C). This step ensures that the document is properly published according to EPO standards.\n\n2. If no appeal is filed against this decision, then within four months from receiving the interlocutory decision, the patent proprietor must comply with the invitation and submit a formally compliant version of the description along with any necessary translations (option D).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it states that the payment for publishing a new specification and filing translations are mandatory upon request. The Guidelines do not require this unless specifically invited to do so by the opposition division.\n\nOption B is correct as it acknowledges that if no appeal is filed, the patent proprietor will be required to comply with these steps but only after receiving an invitation from the opposition division (within four months). It correctly identifies that these actions are not mandatory until formally requested and pending any appeal proceedings.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it suggests that this request for compliance would happen simultaneously with the interlocutory decision.

Therefore, under Rule 161(1), there will be no further communication from the EPO regarding this application after the six-month period as set by Rule 162(3).\n\n**Why Options B, C, and D are incorrect:**\n\n- **Option B (Form 1226BB offering an opportunity to comment and file amendments):**\n  This option is not applicable because the amendments filed under Article 19 PCT during the international phase have already been considered as a response. There is no need for further communication requesting additional comments or amendments.\n\n- **Option C (Form 1226CC offering an opportunity to file amendments before the supplementary European search report is drawn up):**\n  The supplementary European search report has not been prepared because there was no request for international preliminary examination, and thus this option does not apply. \n\n- **Option D (Form 1226AC stating that the examination has started):**\n  Since there have been no further amendments or requests filed with the EPO in the regional phase, it is premature to state that the examination process has officially started. The examination will begin only after a formal communication from the EPO regarding the regional phase, which is not indicated here.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and guidelines, the correct answer is B (Form 1226BB offering the opportunity to comment and file amendments), although in this specific case, no such form would be sent since the required response has already been considered.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_2.html"

                    "Justification": "The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore as IPEA. Explanation according to the provided legal text: 1. **ISA Selection**: According to the guidelines, the EPO may act as an International Searching Authority (ISA) for PCT applications under Article 153(2). This means that Company M can indeed select the EPO as its ISA. 2. **IPEA Selection**: Similarly, the applicant has the option to choose the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), also in line with the provisions under Article 153(2) and possibly other relevant PCT articles. Why options B, C are incorrect: - **Option B** mentions choosing the USPTO as ISA. While the USPTO can act as an ISA, it is not mentioned or required for the scenario described in the question where Mexico’s local institute filed the application. Therefore, this option does not align with the provided information.  - **Option C** suggests the Austrian Patent Office as ISA and EPO as IPEA. However, there is no specific mention of the Austrian Patent Office acting as an ISA or having a preference over other offices for such roles in the PCT context described by the guidelines. Why option A is incorrect: - Option A combines the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA. Although both entities can serve these roles, it is not necessary to choose one office as ISA and another as IPEA unless specified by the applicant or required for specific cases. The question does not provide enough context to conclude that such a combination is mandatory. Therefore, based on the given text, D is the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the guidelines provided in A-III, 6.9 and F-VI, 1.3 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO:\n\n- For a valid claim to priority, the European application must be made during a period of twelve months from the date of filing of the previous application (F-VI, 1.3(iii)). The time limit to add or correct a priority claim is generally within this twelve-month period.\n- A late-filed request for re-establishment of rights in respect of a priority claim will be accepted if it is filed before the European patent application's filing date plus six months (Art. 87(4) EPC).\n\nIn the given scenario, applicant P validly filed an international patent application PCT-P on 20 June 2023, claiming priority from EP-I filed on 7 July 2022. He should have also claimed priority from EP-II filed on 3 July 2022.\n\nThe latest date by which applicant P could add the missing priority claim (EP-II) is 3 months after the filing date of the European application, i.e., within three months of 20 June 2023.\n\nTherefore, the time limit for adding the priority claim from EP-II would be:\n\n- **3 July 2023 + 3 months = 3 October 2023.**\n\nSince today is 12 October 2023, the deadline has already passed.\n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they suggest a later date for adding the priority claim.\nOption A is incorrect as it suggests a date that is within the valid period but does not account for the passage of time since applicant P discovered the missing priority.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\nD. No, the time limit for adding the priority claim expired on 3 July 2023.\nApplicant P can no longer add or correct this missing priority claim as it has exceeded the valid period to do so.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_3.html"

There is no indication in the provided context that any further action is required beyond filing the comments. The procedural deadline for submitting comments has been adhered to, and there are no provisions suggesting an extension request or additional fees are necessary.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: The opponent/respondent does not need to request an extension of the period for comment since they have filed their comments within four months after receiving the communication.\n- **Option B**: There is no basis in the legal context provided that necessitates a fee for further processing, as the opposition division’s decision has been appealed and the opponent/respondent's comments are being considered within the normal procedural timeframe.\n- **Option C**: The opponent/respondent does not need to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights or pay any associated fees. Reestablishment of rights is relevant in cases where there has been an issue with the validity of the patent itself, which is not applicable here as the appeal process is ongoing.\n\nTherefore, D is correct as none of the above actions are required given the current procedural status.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.11.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_11_3_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, renewal fees for a divisional application or any European patent application are due starting from the filing date of the earlier (parent) application or that of the root application in the case of a sequence of divisional applications. The third year and each subsequent year's renewal fee falls due on the anniversary of the filing date.\n\nIn this scenario, the parent application was filed on 20 March 2020, which means the third year would be from 21 March 2023 to 20 March 2024, and the fourth year is from 21 March 2024 onwards. Since no renewal fees have been paid for the divisional application as of 12 October 2023:\n\n- Option B states that the renewal fees can be validly paid without any additional fee by 30 April 2024, which is correct according to A-IV, 1.4.3.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect based on the following reasoning:\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that as no renewal fees have been paid, the application would be deemed withdrawn. However, this statement does not align with the provided legal text. The EPO's Guidelines indicate that a payment can still be made within certain deadlines to avoid the application being treated as withdrawn.\n- **Option C**: States that an additional fee of 50% of the renewal fees paid late should apply by 30 April 2024 at the latest. According to A-IV, 1.4.3, this would be applicable if the fees were paid after six months from the due date, which is not the case here as we are still within that timeframe.\n- **Option D**: Suggests a payment of renewal fees by 31 October 2023 at the latest without any additional fee. However, since the third year's renewal fee would have fallen due on 21 March 2023 and the fourth one will fall due in March 2024, this option does not provide sufficient time for payment according to A-IV, 1.4.3.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct as it accurately reflects that the renewal fees can be validly paid without any additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest based on the provided legal text and guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is D because none of the given statements accurately reflect all actions required for an applicant in China to enter the European phase with a PCT application 25 months after filing, especially considering that a request for early processing has been filed. According to E-IX, 2.8 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, when acting as a designated Office, the EPO must not process or examine an international application before expiry of the period applicable under Art. 22 PCT (Art. 23(1) PCT). However, with a request for early processing under Art. 23(2) PCT, the applicant can trigger this earlier processing at any time.\n\nTo enter the European phase after filing and when no priority is claimed, the applicant must complete Form 1200 (which is required in all cases to start the national phase). They need to pay only the filing fee for the national phase, as the search was already performed by CNIPA. No additional fees like a renewal fee for the third year are necessary at this stage since the application has not yet reached that milestone. Appointing a representative is also not mandatory unless specifically required by EPO rules or the applicant's choice.\n\nHere’s why options A, B, and C are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: Completing and filing Form 1200 and paying both the filing fee and the search fee (option A) overstates what is necessary. The search was already performed in China, so no additional search fee should be paid.\n- **Option B**: While it includes the correct actions of completing and filing Form 1200 and paying the filing fee, as well as the renewal fee for the third year, this is incorrect because the application has not yet reached the point where a renewal fee would apply. Also, it does not include any action related to requesting early processing.\n- **Option C**: Completing and filing Form 1200, paying the filing fee, search fee (which is already paid by CNIPA), and appointing a representative are all unnecessary for this specific situation.\n\nThus, D is the correct choice as it accurately reflects that none of the provided statements encompass all actions required.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

This conclusion is supported by E-III, 2.3 of the guidelines, which states that a request for refund must be made within six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report (E-III, 1.1). Since there is no indication that the application was refused or withdrawn before the publication and assuming the fee was paid within a month of filing, it can be concluded that the designation fee has been validly paid and cannot be refunded.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html"

In this case, the applicant noticed that the renewal fee should not be debited and can therefore revoke the order prior to its execution on 18 October 2024. The latest point for revoking the order is one business day before the scheduled execution date (i.e., 17 October 2024), as this allows sufficient time for any necessary adjustments.\n\nWhy Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **Option A: 10 October 2024** - While the application was filed on 10 October, the applicant had already noticed the error and could not revoke an order that hasn't been created yet.\n- **Option C: 18 October 2024** - By this time, the execution date has passed. According to Rule 68(4), once a debit order is executed, it cannot be revoked in part.\n- **Option D: A debit order cannot be revoked in part** - This option is incorrect because Rule 68(4) clearly states that an order can be revoked in whole or in part at any time before execution.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, as the applicant must revoke the renewal fee debit order by 17 October 2024 to prevent its execution on 18 October 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the applicant has several remedies available after missing a time limit.\n\n1. **Option A - Filing a Notice of Appeal**: Article 101(3) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Patent Office (RPEPO) allows an applicant to file a notice of appeal against a decision to refuse an application within four months of notification of the refusal, as per Rule 102. This option is available if the applicant believes that the refusal was based on errors in law or fact.\n\n2. **Option B - Request for Further Processing**: According to Article 99(3) EPC and Rule 75(6), a decision may be given once all formal requirements have been fulfilled, even if an internal EPO time limit has not yet expired. Therefore, the applicant can request further processing within two months of notification under Rule 102(4). This would allow the application to proceed despite the missed time limit.\n\n3. **Option C - Request for Re-establishment of Rights**: Article 122 and Rule 136 provide for re-establishment of rights if the applicant can show sufficient cause, such as force majeure or other extenuating circumstances that prevented compliance with a time limit.\n\n**Why B, C are Correct:**\n- **Option B** is correct because the Guidelines explicitly state that decisions may be given even if an internal EPO time limit has not expired, provided all formal requirements have been met.\n- **Option C** is correct as re-establishment of rights can be requested if a valid reason for missing the time limit exists.\n\n**Why D is Correct:**\n- All three options (A, B, and C) are viable remedies based on the EPO Guidelines. Missing the deadline to file a designation of inventor would likely fall under circumstances where either an appeal or re-establishment could be applicable, depending on the applicant's specific situation.\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x_1_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 1 and J 26/95, when the International Searching Authority (ISA) identifies multiple inventions that require separate search fees beyond the initial fee paid with the international patent application, a written response is required. The ISA will provide a provisional opinion and an invitation to pay additional search fees. If you fail to comply with this request within the given time limit, your international patent application may be deemed withdrawn.\n\n- **Option A** states that 'You must pay two additional search fees by 25 October 2024'. This is correct because the ISA has set a deadline for paying these fees and it is your obligation to do so. Typically, this deadline would be within three months from the date of communication (which was on 25 September 2024), unless extended.\n\n- **Option B** states that 'You do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results.' This is incorrect because you are required to respond and pay any additional fees if unity of invention has not been met. Ignoring this communication could result in your application being deemed withdrawn or further actions being taken against it.\n\n- **Option C** states that 'If you pay two additional search fees under protest, you must pay two protest fees within the time limit.' This is incorrect according to the provided legal text. There is no mention of protest fees for paying additional search fees. Paying additional search fees is a necessary step if unity of invention has not been met.\n\n- **Option D** states that 'If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the international patent application will be deemed to be withdrawn.' This statement is generally correct based on EPO practice; however, in some scenarios, a response might still be possible. Typically, such a situation would require further communication from the ISA or EPO for clarification and potential resolution of the issue. Nevertheless, failing to pay additional search fees within the time limit will likely result in your application being deemed withdrawn unless specific exceptions apply.\n\nIn conclusion, option A is correct because it accurately reflects the obligation to pay the additional search fees within the specified time frame as per the ISA’s communication.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

This means that for the given scenario, where no certified copy was filed with the EPO as the receiving Office on 10 September 2024, the applicant has until the ISA's decision is communicated.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are incorrect based on the legal context:\n\n- **Option B (Submit a valid DAS code to the International Bureau to enable it to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application)**: The Digital Access Service (DAS) is not mentioned or required in the PCT rules for obtaining priority documents. The ISA and EPO are responsible for handling such requests, making this option unnecessary.\n\n- **Option C (File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO)**: There is no specific provision that allows applicants to file a certified copy directly with the EPO under PCT Article 41(2) without going through the ISA or EPO's procedure. The ISA must still be involved in this process.\n\n- **Option D (File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau)**: The International Bureau is part of WIPO and handles international matters, but it does not directly receive priority documents from national offices like the Luxembourg IPO without an official request or notification mechanism. Therefore, this option is not in accordance with PCT procedures.\n\nThus, the most appropriate action under these circumstances is Option A, requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B because a renewal fee for EP-X-C0 should be due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 5th year. According to the guidelines, renewal fees are payable from the third year onwards and calculated from the filing date of the earlier (parent) application or root application in cases of divisional applications.\\n\\nIn this scenario:\\n- The parent application EP-X was filed on 1 October 2020.\\n- The mention of grant for EP-X-C0 (the unitary effect version of the patent) is registered on 10 October 2024, which means that the fifth year has just started.\\n\\nFor a European patent application, renewal fees are due in respect of the third and subsequent years from the filing date. Since the parent application's filing date is considered as the starting point for calculating the renewal fee period, it would be the same for EP-X-C0 (the divisional application). Therefore, the fifth year starts on 1 October 2024, which means that a renewal fee should be due by 31 October 2024.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A**: This option states that a renewal fee still has to be paid for EP-X. However, since EP-X is the parent application and not the divisional one (EP-X-C0), it doesn't apply because we're focusing on the unitary effect version.\\n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly states that the 6th year's renewal fee should be due in respect of EP-X-C0. It would actually be the fifth year, as explained above.\\n- **Option D**: This is incorrect because a renewal fee must still be paid for the divisional application (EP-X-C0) to maintain its validity.\\n\\nBased on the provided legal text and context, B is the correct choice as it accurately reflects when and what kind of renewal fees are due.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

Since the applicant received the letter on 21 September 2024, and the time limit set in the communication is four months, we need to add four months to 21 September 2024.\n\nStarting with September (which has 30 days) means that 21 September plus one month brings us to 21 October. Adding another month takes us to 21 November. Finally, adding the last month of the four-month period lands us on 21 December. However, since we are setting a deadline and need an exact date, we will use the first day of the next month if it is not specifically mentioned as 'by end of the month,' which in this case would be 31 December.\n\nAdding one more month to December brings us to January 2025. Since the question asks for the last day, and assuming a typical calendar, we set the date to the 31st of the final month, but since the provided options do not include that specific date, the closest option is B: 12 January 2025.\n\n### Explanation why other choices are incorrect:\n- **A. 13 January 2025**: This is a day after the calculated last day (31 December), making it incorrect.\n- **C. 22 January 2025**: This date is even further beyond the correct deadline, thus incorrect.\n- **D. 14 January 2025**: This choice is also later than the exact end of the four-month period and therefore not the last allowable day for replying.\n\nAccording to the provided legal text and guidelines (E-VIII, 1.6), such deadlines are calculated based on the date of receipt plus the stipulated time limit, leading us to conclude that B: 12 January 2025 is the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VI, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vi_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html"

The text states: 'The EPO Contingency Upload Service can be used if you are not able to file an application or a request using the EPO's normal filing systems and you have no other means of making your filing.'\n\nThis directly aligns with option C, indicating that it is recommended when there is a system outage at the EPO.\n\nNow, let’s explain why options A, B, and D are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A: When you submit documents after business hours** - The guidelines do not mention using the EPO Contingency Upload Service for document submission outside of normal business hours. Typically, submissions can be made even during off-hours through standard systems if they function correctly.\n\n- **Option B: When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end** - The guidelines specify that the Contingency Upload Service is intended for situations where there is an issue with the EPO's systems, not just user-end technical issues. Therefore, this scenario does not warrant using the service as described.\n\n- **Option D: When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday** - The service is specifically designed to address system outages or failures and not for routine closure periods like holidays where services might be unavailable but systems are functioning normally.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_10.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 3.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_3_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html"

In this case, since Korhonen's original filing was in Finnish and he provided an English translation, any subsequent claims must be filed in either Finnish or English.\n\n- Option A is incorrect because although the amended claims would initially need to be submitted in Finnish (the original application language), a translation into English would also be required according to Article 14(3).\n- Option B incorrectly states that Korhonen can file amended claims in any official EPO language, which contradicts the requirement of filing them only in the original application language or its translation.\n- Option D is incorrect as it suggests that Korhonen cannot submit the amendments in Finnish at all, whereas the guidelines allow for this if he provides a translation.\n\nTherefore, option C correctly states that Korhonen can file the amended claims in Finnish provided he translates them into English.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_7.html"
