Additionally, the natural person (Dutch nationality resident in Germany) may also benefit from a reduced fee but not due to their employment or company’s size.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect: The applicant's nationality is Belgian, and they are filing in French, which does not qualify for an automatic reduction under Rule 6 EPC. Belgium has no specific agreement that would provide this type of fee exemption.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect: Although the Swiss nationality may have some reduced fee arrangements with the European Patent Office, it is not a universal rule and requires specific agreements. Since there's no mention of an agreement between Switzerland and the EPO for reduced fees in all cases, the natural person resident in the USA cannot claim this benefit based on just their Swiss nationality.\n\nThus, Option A is correct as Andorra has an agreement that qualifies the applicant for fee reductions under Rule 6 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Case Law II, A.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_a_8.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

Since Mr Van Holland has not filed an English translation and his divisional application EP-div is in Dutch, he can remedy the deficiency by filing an English translation within two months of receiving the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC.

The due date for the fourth year's renewal fee in this case would be 16 November 2023 (the anniversary date of the application), as no additional fees are applicable if the grant communication was received after the start of the sixth patent year and before the publication date.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The due date for the fourth year's renewal fee, when paid centrally to the EPO, should be 16 November 2023, not 30 November 2023. Rule 51(2) indicates that if the grant communication was received after the start of the sixth patent year but before the next possible date for publication, an additional fee is payable with the renewal fee.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The statement in option C refers to paying separately in each state where the patent is validated. Since only two contracting states are mentioned for validation, and there has been a communication under Article 97(1) EPC (grant), payment should be made centrally to the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Similar to C, this option also incorrectly suggests that the renewal fee needs to be paid separately in each state. Additionally, the due date for the fourth year's renewal fee, when paid centrally, would not extend until 16 January 2024; hence, it cannot be validly paid by 16 January 2024 at the latest, as this is the deadline for the fifth-year payment.\n\nThus, A is the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n\nThe correct choice is A since Company M can validly designate both the EPO and USPTO as their respective ISA and IPEA for their PCT application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: PCT Article 11, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//articles/a11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Article 19(3) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), a priority claim can be added within nine months from the filing date of the original application. The filing date of PCT-P is 20 June 2023, so the time limit for adding the missing priority claim would expire on 19 March 2024. However, if there are good reasons to justify the delay, such as a discovery after the initial filing, the deadline can be extended by up to six months from the date of the discovery (Article 19(5) EPC). Therefore, since today is 12 October 2023, and assuming that the reason for the delayed claim was discovered on this day or before, the time limit would extend until 3 November 2023. This makes option A correct.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: If we follow the strict nine-month period without any extension, today's date (12 October 2023) does not allow for a claim to be added on or after 7 November 2023; hence, this option cannot be correct as it places the deadline before the actual time limit.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The nine-month period from the filing date (20 June 2023) would not expire until 19 March 2024. Today's date (12 October 2023) and any potential extension due to good reasons discovered today, do not place the deadline on or before 20 October 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The strict nine-month period would only expire after the initial filing date plus this period, which is 3 July 2024. Since the actual discovery and need to add a priority claim came much later, this option cannot be correct as it places the deadline before both the initial filing date of the application and any potential extensions due to good reasons for delay.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_12.html"

Therefore, since the opponent/respondent filed their comments after the four-month period specified in the communication dated 1 June 2023, they need to request an extension.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no requirement mentioned that the opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing just because the comments were filed late. The ROPP does not specify such a fee for extensions of time requests in this context.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The opponent/respondent did not lose their rights by filing comments after the deadline, as there was no requirement to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay an associated fee. Rule 83(2) only mentions requesting an extension of time.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since A is correct, option D cannot be the answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 82, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r82.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_2.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct: According to Rule 51 EPC, if no renewal fee has been paid by the time proceedings are resumed after an interruption, it can be validly paid with an additional fee within six months from that date. Since the proceedings have been resumed on October 12, 2023, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by April 12, 2024 (six months after resumption). This aligns with option C.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The application does not automatically become withdrawn simply because no renewal fee has been paid. It only becomes withdrawn if the time limit for payment expires without payment or a valid reason, such as an extension being granted.\n  \n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Option B suggests that the fees can be validly paid without any additional fee by October 31, 2023. However, Rule 51 EPC requires an additional fee to be paid within six months from the date of resumption, which in this case would be by April 12, 2024.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Option D states that the fees can be validly paid without any additional fee by October 31, 2023. This is incorrect because Rule 51 EPC mandates an additional fee to be paid within six months from the date of resumption, which would be April 12, 2024 in this case.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Since no priority was claimed and the application has no more than 35 pages and 15 claims, there is no need to pay the renewal fee for the third year as it would be due only after 4 years from filing. A representative needs to be appointed only if the applicant chooses to do so or in certain cases not covered here.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The application does not meet the criteria for paying the renewal fee (third year) since it was filed less than 26 months ago and no priority was claimed, which means the third-year renewal fee would be due at least 40 months after filing. \n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** While appointing a representative might be advisable in some cases, there is no legal requirement to do so merely for entry into the EP phase based on the provided information.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Options A and B include actions that are relevant and required based on the given scenario, making \"None of the above statements\" incorrect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html"

The filing date itself does not relate to the time frame for withdrawing and seeking a refund of the designation fee.\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The applicant can still withdraw the application within six months from the mention of the publication of the European search report, even though the fees were validly paid, to seek a refund.\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

In this case, since the intended execution date is 18 October 2024, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee would be 17 October 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Revoking an order on the same day it is specified to be executed (10 October 2024) would not provide enough time for the EPO to process and reverse the debit, as mentioned in Point 10.2 ADA where a two-month period for objection must also be considered if there's disagreement.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Revoking an order on its intended execution date (18 October 2024) would not allow any processing time to reverse the debit, which violates the guideline under Point 13 ADA that requires revocation before the intended execution date.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: While a complete debit order cannot be revoked in part according to Point 10.2 ADA (which does not apply here since we are focusing on revoking just one fee), the specific case at hand allows for partial revocation as long as it adheres to the guidelines regarding timing and procedures.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html"

This is part of the procedures outlined in Rule 39(1) EPC, which requires you to file an objection or comments on the ISA’s communication.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Paying a protest fee under protest does not apply here since the requirement is to pay for additional search services that are necessary given the identified inventions. There is no specific provision in Rule 45 EPC regarding protest fees for this situation.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, the ISA will send a communication informing you that your international application has been deemed withdrawn, but it does not happen automatically.

While DAS (Digital Access Service) can facilitate obtaining copies of documents from various offices, it requires a valid code and does not ensure that the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office will send an official certified copy specifically to the EPO. The EPO must receive an officially authenticated document for its records.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. Filing an electronic certified copy directly with the EPO may be permissible in some cases, but it would need to be verified and authenticated by the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office first. Submitting a request ensures that the official process is followed correctly.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

Thus, there cannot be no renewal fee to pay on that date.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html"

In this case, the four-month period starts from September 13, 2024 (the day after the letter was received on September 21, 2024). Calculating four months from September 13, 2024 brings us to January 12, 2025. Therefore, option B is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The last day for replying would not be January 13, 2025, as this falls outside the four-month period calculated from September 13, 2024.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The last day for replying would not be January 22, 2025, as this date extends beyond the four-month period starting on September 13, 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The last day for replying would not be January 14, 2025, as this also falls outside the calculated four-month period.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_7.html"

The EPO Contingency Upload Service is specifically mentioned as an option for submitting documents when there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via the standard filing systems, making it suitable in situations where regular online services are unavailable.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. When the EPO's filing systems are functioning correctly but there is a technical issue on your end, the EPO recommends using the EPO web-form filing service or other available electronic communication methods rather than the Contingency Upload Service.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The EPO does not specifically recommend using the Contingency Upload Service for submitting documents after business hours; regular online submission methods are usually sufficient during such times if the systems are operational.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. During official holidays when the EPO is closed, all filing and communication systems are typically inaccessible, making the use of any electronic service, including the Contingency Upload Service, inappropriate.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_7.html"

Therefore, Korhonen can file the amended claims in Finnish and provide a translation into English (an official language of the EPO), as long as this translation is filed in time.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: It states that Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish first before providing an English translation. This is not necessary according to Rule 3(1) and the filing rules.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it allows for a translation into any official language, it lacks specificity on the timing, which implies immediate provision of such a translation, which might be a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the rules.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: It outright prohibits Korhonen from filing in Finnish, whereas Rule 3(1) permits him to use any official language for his filings.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

The letter should contain informal comments aimed at overcoming objections raised in the search opinion.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** For PCT Direct to be available, the priority application must have been examined by the EPO, which means it must have a search report and a written opinion issued by an examining division. Since the EP application mentioned (filed in French) has only undergone searching but not examination, PCT Direct would not be applicable.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is correct:** If the priority application is already an international application filed with the EPO in English and searched by the EPO, and the subsequent international application is also filed in English using Online Filing 2.0, PCT Direct can be used to address objections raised in the search opinion.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is correct:** Amended claims are required to be submitted as part of the PCT Direct letter if there are specific objections related to claim clarity or support from the description that need addressing.

Since Mr Linguist is requesting unitary effect under the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA), which is applicable to 18 states, he must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of those 18 states.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: While Dutch is one of the languages in which Mr Linguist initially filed his application and might be considered for a domestic priority, it does not qualify as an official language under the UPCA for this purpose. Therefore, providing a translation into Dutch would not satisfy the requirement for unitary effect.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The UPCA has 24 states that have signed or acceded to it, but only those 18 states are currently in force and applicable for Mr Linguist's request. Thus, translations must be provided according to the official languages of these 18 states, not all 24.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Spanish is not an official language of any state within the current scope of the UPCA (i.e., the 18 states where unitary effect can currently be requested). Therefore, providing a translation into Spanish would not meet the legal requirement for immediate registration of the unitary effect.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_8.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"
