According to A-II, 4.1.4, if the required information under Rule 40(1)(b) (such as applicant's contact details) is missing or cannot be sent due to the deficiency, it does not directly relate to the re-establishment of rights process.\n\nOption D: 'Time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights' is incorrect. This option is somewhat redundant and misinterprets the process. The document discusses the potential need to pay a fee when requesting further processing (like A.1, 2) but does not mention an additional fee specifically for applying for re-establishment of rights.\n\nTherefore, Answer B correctly identifies that time limits related to examination requests can be remedied by seeking re-establishment of rights if missed due to unavoidable circumstances.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3.html"

This is based on Rule 36(2) of the EPO Rules of Procedure, as stated in Art. 61.\n\nNow let's examine why options B, C, and D are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A: The deficiency cannot be remedied.** This statement is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of filing a translation within the required timeframe. According to Rule 36(2), the application can still be processed if the translation is filed in time.\n  \n- **Option C: Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP -div together with a request for further processing.** This statement is incorrect because simply filing a request for further processing without the required translation would not address the deficiency and therefore does not comply with Rule 36(2).\n\n- **Option D: Mr Van Holland needs to file an English translation of EP -div together with a request for re-establishment of rights.** This option is also incorrect as it suggests that Mr Van Holland has lost his rights, which is not the case if he files the necessary translation within two months. The correct procedure under Rule 36(2) does not involve filing a request for re-establishment of rights but rather submitting the required translation.\n\nThus, B is the only correct answer as it accurately reflects the legal requirement to file an English translation within the specified timeframe.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

For a European patent application filed on November 16, 2020, the fourth-year renewal fee would be due in November 2024. Since today is October 12, 2023, the due date for the fourth-year renewal fee (November 2024) has not yet arrived.\n\nThe communication received on October 12, 2023, states that the EPO intends to grant a European patent valid in two contracting states. According to Rule 51(3), if the patent is validated only in two Contracting States and Article 86 of the EPC applies, then:\n\n- The renewal fee for the fourth year (which would fall due in November 2024) can be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated.\n- Renewal fees due within four months from the date of notification may still be paid without an additional fee until four months after the notification. Since the communication was received on October 12, 2023, adding four months would place the latest valid payment date at February 12, 2024.\n\nGiven that the due date for the fourth-year renewal fee is November 2024 and the current context (grant notification), Option B correctly states that the renewal fee must be paid centrally to the EPO with a due date of 30 November 2024. However, considering the context of validating in only two contracting states and the specific timing provided by Rule 51(3):\n\n- The correct due date would actually align with Option C: 'The renewal fee for the fourth year must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated. The renewal fee for the fourth year can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest.'\n\nOption B incorrectly states a central payment to the EPO, which is not applicable given that validation is only in two states.\n\nOptions C and D are correct based on Rule 51(3), but Option C uses the correct due date of 9 January 2024 (four months from October 12, 2023).\n\nOption D incorrectly uses a later date as the deadline for paying without an additional fee, which is incorrect.\n\nThus, while B technically aligns with current payment rules if interpreted literally, C more accurately reflects the specific circumstances and timeframes provided by Rule 51(3).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

Under Rule 161(2), the European Patent Office (EPO) will issue Form 1226BB to provide the applicant the opportunity to comment and file additional amendments.\n\n- **Why B is correct:** \n    - Form 1226BB is issued when there are no further amendments filed with the EPO upon entry into the regional phase, but the applicant still has an opportunity to respond and amend their application. Since Rule 159(1)(b) allows for the option of entering the European phase either with the documents amended in the international phase or as originally filed, and the EPO grants a set time limit for further amendments (Rule 161(2)), Form 1226BB is appropriate.\n\n- **Why A is incorrect:**\n    - Form 1226AA is typically used when there has been no response to the communication under Rule 161(1) and the application is considered withdrawn if not replied to within the prescribed time limit. Since amendments were made during the international phase, this form would not be applicable.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect:**\n    - Form 1226CC pertains specifically to the opportunity to file amendments before the supplementary European search report (SERC) is drawn up under Rule 159(1)(b). However, since no further amendments were filed after entering the regional phase, this form would not be issued.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect:**\n    - Form 1226AC states that the examination has started.

The applicant has other choices for both ISA and IPEA.\\n- **Option C (Austrian Patent Office as ISA and EPO as IPEA):** Again, while this could be another valid combination, it is not necessary or required based on the given scenario.\\n- **Option D (EPO as ISA and Intellectual Property Office of Singapore as IPEA):** This is a permissible combination, but it is not mandatory for an applicant with a PCT application filed in Spanish. The choice between EPO and other offices like the USPTO or Singapore IP Office depends on the applicant's preference.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B: Yes, the time limit for adding the priority claim expires on 7 November 2023. According to Rule 17.1 and 17.2 of the PCT, as referenced in 'Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5,' multiple priorities may be claimed in respect of a European patent application from different countries. The time limit for claiming additional prior applications is generally within 12 months from the filing date of the earliest priority application.\\n\\nIn this scenario:\\n- Applicant P filed an international patent application (PCT-P) on 20 June 2023, which claims the priority of EP-I, filed on 7 July 2022.\\n- The second prior application (EP-II), filed on 3 July 2022, was not claimed in PCT-P.\\n\\nThe time limit for adding a claim to additional prior applications is from the filing date of the earliest claimed priority application. Here, EP-I is the earliest priority application with a filing date of 7 July 2022. Thus, the applicant had until 6 months plus one day after this date (13 January 2024) to add additional priorities.\\n\\nHowever, the specific rule under Rule 19(1) PCT states that 'the claim to priority must be made not later than six months from the filing of the application in which priority is claimed.' This means for EP-II filed on 3 July 2022, the time limit would end exactly one year after its filing date.\\n\\nTherefore:\\n- The deadline for adding the additional priority claim from EP-II, as of today (12 October 2023), falls on 3 July 2023 + 12 months = 3 July 2024. But since we are still within a grace period of one day after this date due to the filing date of PCT-P, it would extend until 7 November 2023 (6 months from the latest valid filing date which is 3 July 2022 + 6 months).\\n\\nExplanation for incorrect options:\\n- Option A: Incorrect because the time limit is not calculated based on EP-I's priority date.\\n- Option C: Incorrect as it does not consider that PCT-P was filed after EP-II and thus extends the deadline by a grace period of one day.\\n- Option D: Incorrect since it is based on the 3 July 2022 filing date of EP-II, which is incorrect for an additional claim.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5.html\nSource: EPC Article 88, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a88.html"

This case involves such an invitation by the board of appeal to the opponent/respondent, which was given on 1 June 2023 with a four-month timeframe for comments. - Option A is incorrect because the opponent/respondent has submitted their comments within the time limit set by the board (by October 12, 2023). There is no indication that an extension of the period would be necessary. - Option B is incorrect as there is no evidence or reference in the legal texts provided that suggests a fee needs to be paid for further processing comments submitted within the stipulated time frame. - Option C is not applicable here since reestablishment of rights and associated fees are relevant when an applicant fails to file a response by the due date, which is not the case as the opponent/respondent has met the deadline. Hence, D is correct: None of the above further actions need to be taken, as the comments were timely filed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 81, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r81.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.4.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_4_3_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 100, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r100.html"

In this case, the applicant was informed that proceedings would be resumed on October 12, 2023.\n\n- **Option B**: Correct. Renewal fees for the third and fourth years (which began on March 21, 2023, and April 30, 2024, respectively) can indeed be validly paid without an additional fee by October 31, 2023.\n\n- **Option A**: Incorrect. The application is not deemed withdrawn merely because no renewal fees have been paid during the interruption period. The EPO's practice as described in Rule 51(2) and other relevant provisions does not consider non-payment of renewal fees during an interruption to be a withdrawal, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n- **Option C**: Incorrect. While renewal fees can be paid with an additional fee by April 30, 2024 (under Rule 51(2)), this is past the latest valid payment date for the fourth-year renewal fee as determined in option B.\n\n- **Option D**: Incorrect. The latest valid payment date without any additional fee is October 31, 2023, according to Rule 51(2), not December 31, 2023 (as implied by October 31, 2023).\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

Since the application has been published already, it can be assumed that the translation of the international application was submitted earlier within the initial 31-month period. The fact that the application is complete with no more than 35 pages and 15 claims suggests there's no need to appoint a representative (Rule 159(1)(f)), as well as no indication for an early processing request to be relevant in this scenario.\n\nWhy B, C, D are incorrect:\n\n- **Answer B**: This option includes the renewal fee for the third year (Rule 159(1)(g)). However, since the question specifies that the application is only 25 months old and has not yet reached the third year of existence, this fee would be due later.\n\n- **Answer C**: While it's true that appointing a representative might be advisable in some cases (Rule 159(1)(f)), there’s no specific legal requirement for all applicants to do so. The other requirements mentioned are directly stipulated and necessary based on the timeline provided, making this option incomplete.\n\n- **Answer D**: This is incorrect because Answer A accurately reflects the required actions as outlined in Rule 159 of the EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html"

The date of mention of the publication of the European search report marks when substantive examination typically begins. Therefore, the latest point in time for withdrawing the application if the applicant wishes to obtain a refund of the designation fee would be six months after this date.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- B (Date of mention of the publication of the European search report) is not correct because it only marks when substantive examination begins but does not represent the end point by which the applicant can withdraw for a partial refund.\n- C (The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded) is incorrect as the guidelines explicitly state that refunds are available under certain conditions, such as withdrawing before the expiry of the time limit for replying to the first invitation under Article 94(3).\n- D (Date of the start of substantive examination) while related to when substantive examination begins, it does not represent the end point by which an application can be withdrawn if one desires a refund of the designation fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 143, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r143.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html"

Such orders are processed in ascending order at the end of the day on the decisive payment date if there are multiple payments from the same deposit account.\n\nIn this case, the applicant has filed a request for entry into the European phase along with a debit order specifying various fees to be debited on 18 October 2024. The text also notes that an automatic debit order may not be restricted to specific types of fees but extends to all specified proceedings.\n\nGiven these conditions and specifically from '2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json,' the relevant section states: 'An automatic debit order extends to all types of fees covered by the automatic debiting procedure and payable in respect of the proceedings specified in it. As the proceedings progress, each fee is automatically debited and treated as having been paid in due time, provided that the deposit account contains sufficient funds.'\n\nThe latest point in time for revoking part of an automatic debit order, such as the renewal fee, would be before its execution on 18 October 2024. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 17 October 2024.\n\nAnswer A (10 October 2024) is incorrect because it's too early in relation to the specified execution date and does not allow sufficient time for the order to be processed correctly by CFP before its execution.\n\nAnswer C (18 October 2024) is also incorrect as it coincides with the date of execution, meaning any revocation would not take effect.\n\nAnswer D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part) is incorrect because the text clearly states that automatic debit orders can indeed be processed and thus potentially revoked before their execution, as long as the relevant time constraints are considered. Therefore, a partial revocation is possible within the specified timeframe.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_2_3.html"

Therefore, option D is correct.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A**: This statement is incorrect because third-party observations do not make the filer a party to the proceedings before the EPO. Additionally, while the applicant may respond to these observations, there is no obligation to do so; they can merely provide comments if desired.\n- **Option B**: While it is true that third-party observations must be filed in writing (as per Rule 114 of the Guidelines), the text specifically mentions that such observations 'may not be filed anonymously,' which implies that anonymous submissions are permissible. Therefore, this statement is too absolute and incorrect based on the provided information.\n- **Option C**: The guidelines state that third-party observations must be filed in writing and do not require an official fee to be paid (as per Rule 114 of the Guidelines for Examination). Furthermore, while it's correct that a statement of grounds is required when filing these observations, this condition is part of the requirement but does not define the essential correctness of the option.

This aligns with option A.\n\n**Option B: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau**\nThis is incorrect because the guidelines do not mention using a Digital Access Service for obtaining a certified copy from the DGPI or any other office in this context. The focus is on the direct request and certification by the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.\n\n**Option C: File an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO**\nThis is incorrect because the guidelines do not specify that one can file an electronic version directly with the EPO for obtaining a priority document. Typically, the EPO requires a paper-based certified copy from the office where the original application was filed.\n\n**Option D: File a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the International Bureau**\nThis is incorrect because the International Bureau (IB) is not mentioned in the context of providing or requesting certified copies for priority claims according to the guidelines provided.

Option D is incorrect as it suggests Firm B should have a right to appeal after withdrawing its opposition, which contradicts standard practice where an opposition's withdrawal typically terminates the proceedings without giving rise to appeals from the opposing party.

However, since unitary effect was registered on the same date as the mention of grant (10 October 2024), this means that the proprietor is not required to pay a separate renewal fee for EP-X, but only for the single European patent with unitary effect.\n\n- **Why Option C is incorrect:** Option C states that a renewal fee is due on 31 October 2024 in respect of the 6th year for EP -X-C0. However, according to Rule 71a(5) and (6), if the European patent application is refused or withdrawn before notification of the grant decision, then the fee for grant and publishing will be refunded. The registration of unitary effect on 10 October 2024 would imply that no such fees are due as there has been a successful grant.\n\n- **Why Option D is incorrect:** Option D states that no renewal fee needs to be paid by 31 October 2024. While this might seem plausible, the correct answer requires payment in respect of the 5th year, which can be derived from Rule 71a(2)(b) and (6). Therefore, it is incorrect to state that no renewal fee needs to be paid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: EPC Rule 71a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r71a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Rule 126(2) EPC, where notification is effected by registered letter, such a letter is deemed to be delivered to the addressee on the tenth day following its posting. The document was posted on September 12, 2024 (the date it bears), and therefore, it is considered delivered nine days later, which is September 21, 2024. Given that a four-month time limit is set for reply according to Article 94(3) EPC, adding four months to this date brings us to January 21, 2025. However, Rule 126(2) also states that if the document was delivered more than seven days after the date it bears (in this case, nine days), the time limit is extended by the number of days over seven. Therefore, the four-month period needs to be extended by two days (the excess beyond seven days). Starting from January 21, 2025, adding one month would bring us to February 21, 2025. Adding another month brings us to March 21, 2025. Finally, adding the remaining two days (since we need a total extension of four days), brings us to January 19, 2025 plus two more days, which is **January 12, 2025**. Option A: **13 January 2025** – This option adds one day too many as per the calculation. Option C: **22 January 2025** – This option adds nine days (four months + two extra) instead of just four months plus two days due to the excess seven-day period. Option D: **14 January 2025** – This option is incorrect as it does not align with the exact calculation needed according to Rule 126(2). Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, S.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 126, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r126.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A"

The provided legal texts support this interpretation as follows:\n\n1. **Rule 3(2) of the EPC** states that the response to the extended European search report (EESR), including any amendments and translations, must be filed in one of the languages of the European Patent Office.\n2. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that a translation into English would be required after filing the claims in Finnish, which does not align with Rule 3(2) allowing for the claim to be initially submitted in a non-official language as long as an official language translation is provided within the time limit.\n3. Option B is incorrect because it implies that Korhonen can file the amended claims in any official language of the EPO, which is not accurate; he specifically must provide a translation into one of these languages to comply with Rule 3(2).\n4. Option D is incorrect as it states that Korhonen is not allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish at all. While this is technically true only if the claims are not accompanied by an official language translation, it does not account for the provision under Rule 3(2) that allows for filing in a non-official language followed by providing the necessary translation.\n\nTherefore, C is correct because Korhonen can file his amended claims in Finnish and subsequently provide a translation into English (or any other official language of the EPO), as per the legal requirement.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is B: Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends. According to Article 6(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012, as stated in the provided content, translations may be in any of the 24 official languages of the EU, except English, irrespective of the language in which the application was filed or the geographical extent of the unitary effect. In this case, since Mr Linguist is requesting a unitary effect on 10 October 2024 and has used Dutch as the language of his original application but English for proceedings, it falls under situation (i) where the application is initially in a non-EPO language (Dutch). Therefore, the translation into an official language of any of the states to which unitary effect extends (18 EU member states who are parties to the Unified Patent Court Agreement) is necessary.\n\nWhy Other Answers Are Incorrect:\nA. Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into Dutch - This option would only be correct if the entire application was initially filed in Dutch, but since it was originally in another language and using English for proceedings, this is not applicable.\nC. Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA - While this seems like a plausible answer due to the broader scope of official languages, the regulation specifically mentions translations in the context of the geographical extent of unitary effect (18 states) and not all 24 signatory states.\nD. Mr Linguist may provide a translation of the specification into Spanish - According to the legal text provided, while there is no restriction on providing translations in any official language, it must be one that would apply to the geographical extent of the unitary effect (18 states), and not necessarily all 24 signatory states. Thus, this option might not strictly comply with the regulation as stated.\n\nThe key legal provision here is ensuring that the translation complies with the specified conditions for unitary effect across the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: EPC Article 70, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a70.html\nSource: EPC Rule 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"
