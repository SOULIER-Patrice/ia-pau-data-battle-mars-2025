This ensures that there is no loss of rights for the application EP -A.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it omits the requirement for the applicant to sign an authorisation, which is necessary to validly appoint new representative Y.\n  \n- Option C is incorrect because it incorrectly sets the deadline for filing a response to the extended European search report as 23 October 2023. The original publication date of the application was on 12 April 2023, and according to Rule 71(1) EPC, an applicant has twelve months from the date of publication to file a reply or enter into proceedings with the EPO.

Once this deadline has passed, the application will not proceed further without paying additional fees or other formal requirements.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The time limit for filing the application within the priority period is considered an essential part of the application and missed deadlines are usually irremediable once the priority period expires. There is no provision in the EPC to request re-establishment of rights for this particular deadline.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself cannot be remedied by a request for re-establishment of rights, as it would create a circular problem where the applicant must pay a fee before having their rights restored.

Since Hassan is not a European patent attorney and there's no indication he has other specific authorizations, he cannot represent Greta before the ISA.\n\n- **Option B is correct**: Under Rule 21.3 of the PCT, a power of attorney signed by the applicant (or their authorized representative) is required for any person to act as an authorized representative. Since Hassan needs such authorization and has not provided it, he cannot act as the International Searching Authority without a proper power of attorney.\n\n- **Option C is correct**: According to Article 34(1) of the PCT, a demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by the applicant or any person duly authorized in writing by the applicant.

Since Mr Van Holland has already paid all fees due for EP-div and not filed an English translation within two months of filing the application (as required under Rule 36(2) EPC), he can remedy the deficiency by doing so within two months of notification of the communication under Rule 112(1) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The statement \"The deficiency cannot be remedied\" is not correct because filing an English translation, which is required to make EP-div admissible, is a possible remedy according to legal provisions.\n  \n- Explanation of why C and D are incorrect: While requesting further processing (as per Rule 139(1) EPC or Article 123(2) EPC) might be necessary in some scenarios for other types of deficiencies, it is not required here. The specific deficiency in this case is related to the language requirement that can be remedied by filing a translation into an official language (English), as outlined in Case Law II, F.3.3.

The communication received from the EPO on 12 October 2023 does not affect this due date.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect.

This means that option A is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: Option B suggests that if a party files an appeal, the patent proprietor will not be required to pay these fees or provide these documents.

Since the applicant has already provided an English translation, they can choose the EPO as the International Searching Authority (ISA), and another office such as the USPTO as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). Thus, option A is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The applicant cannot choose the USPTO as ISA because it does not have the authority to act as an ISA for PCT applications.\n  \n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Similar to B, Austria's patent office (Österreichisches Patentamt) is not recognized by the PCT system as having the authority to act as an ISA.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore does not have the status of a Recognized IPEA under the PCT. Only designated offices that are parties to the PCT can be chosen as ISAs and IPEAs, and these include the EPO among others, but they must also meet other criteria such as being an \"international preliminary examining authority\" (IPEA).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-X, 9.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_x_9_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html"

The time limit for adding or correcting a priority claim runs from the date on which the first priority was claimed (in this case, July 7, 2022). Thus, the applicant has until 3 November 2023 to add the second priority claim (EP -II), as it is within twelve months of the earliest priority date.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The time limit for adding or correcting a priority claim does not depend on the filing date of the European patent application, but rather from the earliest priority date. Therefore, October 12, 2023, plus one month equals November 12, 2023, and not November 7, 2023.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The time limit for adding or correcting a priority claim does not start from the current date (October 12, 2023), but from the earliest priority date. Thus, it cannot be less than the earliest priority date plus twelve months.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: As explained above, the applicant has until November 3, 2023, to add or correct the priority claim, which is after July 3, 2023, and not before.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Case Law II, D.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_d_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_5.html"

This is because the default timeframe provided by the board must be adhered to unless formally extended.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The question does not indicate any additional fees for further processing are required just because the comments were submitted late. Any necessary fee would have been due upon filing the appeal or when originally notified, and there's no indication that a new fee is now applicable.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** There is no basis to conclude that the opponent/respondent needs to file a request for reestablishment of rights. The question does not suggest any issue related to the patentee losing their rights or having their time limits expire, which would necessitate such a request and associated fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Since option A accurately describes what the opponent/respondent should do in this scenario, option D cannot be correct as it states \"None of the above.\"\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_3.html"

The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest, as per Rule 51(2) EPC, which states that if the application's rights are re-established under Article 122 EPC, renewal fees due within four months from the date of notification can still be paid within six months.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect. The application does not automatically become withdrawn merely because no renewal fee has been paid. It depends on whether the applicant requests further processing and pays the required fee under Rule 137 EPC, as described in Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The third year's renewal fee should have been due by 31 March 2023 (one year after filing), and the fourth year’s renewal fee will be due on 31 March 2024. Both fees require payment with an additional fee if paid beyond the normal time limit, as per Rule 51(2) EPC.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The third-year renewal fee was already overdue by October 2023, and therefore would not be validly paid without the additional fee. The fourth year’s renewal fee can only be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: EPC Rule 45, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r45.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:**  \n  According to the guidelines provided, for an international application that has been published and includes a search report from CNIPA, filing into the European phase can be done after 25 months from the filing date if a request for early processing has already been filed. The applicant only needs to complete and file Form 1200 and pay the corresponding fees, which typically include the filing fee and the search fee (as the application is published with a search report). Since no priority was claimed, there is no need to pay a renewal fee, and as early processing has been requested, appointing a representative might not be required for this specific action.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:**  \n  Option B suggests paying the renewal fee for the third year, which is unnecessary at this stage since the application is still in its initial period (up to 25 months from filing). Renewal fees are typically due later and only if the application is granted or extended into a longer protection term.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:**  \n  Option C proposes appointing a representative, which may not be required for simply entering the European phase. While it's a valid option in general to appoint a representative, this step isn't mandatory when completing Form 1200 and paying fees for entry into the EP phase.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:**  \n  Option D states \"None of the above,\" which contradicts the correct answer that has been identified as A.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_2.html"

The period of six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report only applies to withdrawing a granted patent from the EPO's register; it has no bearing on the designation fee.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:** According to the guidelines provided under A-X, 7.1.2, a distinction must be drawn between conditions for valid payment and the indication of the purpose of the payment. The person making the payment will be requested to communicate the purpose in writing within a specified period if the purpose of the payment cannot immediately be established. In this case, since the applicant noticed that the renewal fee was not yet due on 10 October 2024 and should not have been debited, the applicant can revoke the order before it is executed to prevent any unauthorized charges.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The option suggests revoking the order one day before execution. However, according to the guidelines, there is no specific time limit mentioned for revoking a debit order once it has been issued and the specified date is within a reasonable period where the applicant can still make changes.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Revoking an executed debit order on 18 October 2024 would be ineffective as the payment would have already been processed by that time. The guidelines do not support partial revocation post-execution, only before or during execution when it can be clearly communicated in writing.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** While D states that a debit order cannot be revoked in part, this option is too absolute and does not consider the possibility of communication within the specified period. The guidelines allow for partial revocation if the purpose is clarified before execution or during the process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 7.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_7_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_12.html"

Specifically, the applicant can file a request for re-establishment of rights within two months from notification of the decision refusing the application, as this is provided for in Article 124(3) EPC. This allows the applicant to remedy the situation where the designation of inventor was not timely filed.\n\n- **Explanation of why A and B are incorrect**:  \n  - Option A (filing a notice of appeal) would be premature since there has been no final decision issued yet, only an internal refusal by the Receiving Section. An appeal can only be filed after the International Searching Authority or European Patent Office issues a decision refusing the application under Article 96(1) EPC.\n  - Option B (filing a request for further processing) is not applicable in this context as the applicant missed the time limit to file the designation of inventor. Further processing requests are typically used when there are no grounds for refusal other than the lapse of a time limit.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Since options A and B do not apply, option D cannot be correct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, E.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_e_2_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to the guidelines for examination procedures, when an International Searching Authority (ISA) identifies that the unity of invention has not been complied with and issues a provisional opinion along with partial search results, applicants are required to pay additional search fees within a specified time frame. Typically, this time limit is two months from the date of communication or such other period as may be indicated in the communication. Therefore, you must pay the additional search fees by 25 October 2024 (assuming a standard 60-day period).\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: You are required to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results to clarify how unity of invention can be achieved among the identified inventions. Failing to do so may result in the ISA issuing a final opinion, which could lead to further delays or complications.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Paying additional search fees under protest does not automatically entitle you to pay two protest fees within the time limit unless specifically required by the EPO guidelines and communicated with your response. Moreover, such an action might be premature without a clear indication from the ISA that it will consider your protest.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the specified time limit, the international patent application will not automatically be deemed withdrawn. Instead, the ISA may issue a final opinion and proceed to the next stage of the examination process, potentially resulting in the divisional filing of the application if unity can be achieved through clarification or amendment.\n\nTherefore, paying two additional search fees by 25 October 2024 is required according to the procedural requirements set by the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html"

The Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office, being the office where the priority application was filed, has the authority and responsibility to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application upon request by the EPO. Hence, option A is the correct action.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Submitting a valid DAS (Digital Access Service) code enables applicants to access digital copies of their documents from various offices but does not directly facilitate obtaining a certified copy for international filing purposes as per Rule 35(2) of the PCT.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Filing an electronic certified copy with the EPO would be unnecessary and redundant because the EPO can request the Luxembourg office to provide the necessary documentation. It would also not comply with the requirement for a certified copy as per Rule 35(2) which specifically mandates that it should come from the relevant patent office.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The International Bureau does not have the authority to prepare and send certified copies of prior applications; this responsibility lies with the office where the application was originally filed, in this case, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office.

This means that from the date unitary effect was registered (10 October 2024), renewal fees are calculated as if it were a single patent with no separate national fees due.\n\n- **A is incorrect** because once unitary effect has been registered, the unified fee system applies, eliminating the need for individual national renewal fees.\n\n- **C is incorrect** since the registration of unitary effect means that the proprietor will be paying based on the 5th year (as of October 2024), not the 6th year.\n\n- **D is incorrect** because while there may be no separate national renewal fees, a unified fee for the 5th year will still need to be paid as part of the unified system.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_5.html"

This service provides an alternative method for submitting documents during such outages.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: While it might be useful in some circumstances, submitting documents after business hours is not specifically indicated as a scenario where the Contingency Upload Service should be used; instead, this could potentially involve other methods like email or courier services depending on the urgency and nature of the submission.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly but you encounter a technical issue at your end, standard filing systems can usually still handle the submission. The Contingency Upload Service is more relevant in cases where the system itself is down, not when there's an internal user-side problem.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday, standard procedures for document submission would cease until after the holiday period ends. However, this scenario does not pertain specifically to technical difficulties with document submission systems but rather to the operational status of the institution. The Contingency Upload Service addresses scenarios where the system itself cannot process documents, not just the closure due to holidays.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-VII, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_vii_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-IV, 2.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iv_2_2_1.html"

In this case, Korhonen is a Finnish national resident in Finland, and Finnish is one of the official EPO languages. Therefore, he can file his amended claims in Finnish and provide a translation into English, which is an official EPO language, in time.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it is true that Korhonen can file the amended claims in any official language of the EPO (including English), this option does not specify the requirement for providing a translation into one of these languages. The regulation requires that the translation be provided simultaneously or later, but within the time limit.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: This statement incorrectly states that Korhonen must file the amended claims in Finnish and then provide an additional English translation. Since he has already provided the translation as required by Article 14(2), this option would result in unnecessary duplication of effort.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it might seem reasonable to think that Korhonen cannot file the amended claims in his native language, the EPO allows for filing documents in an admissible non-EPO language if certain conditions are met, as described above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law II, F.3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_3_3.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html"

The availability of PCT Direct depends on other factors such as the language of the priority application and whether it is an EP or EPO-filed international application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-III, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_iii_10.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

Since the unitary effect extends to 18 states, Mr Linguist can provide a translation into an official language of any of these 18 states.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The specification must be translated into an official language of one of the 18 states, not necessarily Dutch (the original language in which it was filed).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The UPCA applies to only 25 member states, but the unitary effect extends only to those 18 states. Thus, translations must be provided for these specific states and not all signing states.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Spanish is one of the official languages of the European Union (and thus a state that could potentially apply), but it does not belong to the list of states that have granted unitary effect in this scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html"
