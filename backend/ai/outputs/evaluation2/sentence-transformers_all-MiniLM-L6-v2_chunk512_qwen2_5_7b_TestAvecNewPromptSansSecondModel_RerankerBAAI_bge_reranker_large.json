This change does not require the consent of the previously designated inventor (Ms Smith) as long as the patent proprietor requests this in writing.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it is true that Ms Smith cannot be deleted during active opposition proceedings, there is no prohibition against making such a correction if no proceedings are pending. The EPO's guidelines allow for amendments to correct errors in inventorship post-grant.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no requirement for the consent of Mr Li (the sole inventor according to the patent proprietor’s claim) to delete Ms Smith from the record as an inventor, especially if the error was recognized by the patent proprietor and they wish to make a correction. The guidelines do not mention needing such consent in this scenario.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The deletion of an inventor can be done unilaterally by the patent proprietor without requiring the consent of Ms Smith, as long as there are no active oppositions or litigation proceedings.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-III, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iii_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_3_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 78, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r78.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 13, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_13.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_2_1.html"

In this case, the time limit for responding to the extended European search report is 12 October 2023 (six months from the date of publication of the EESR, which was on 12 April 2023). The applicant must also file an authorization signed by the applicant to ensure that any acts done by the new representative are valid. Therefore, options A and D meet these requirements.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: While option B correctly states the need for a change in representation and filing a response to the extended European search report with the EPO by 12 October 2023 at the latest, it omits the requirement for an authorization signed by the applicant. This omission could lead to acts done by the new representative being deemed invalid.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The date given in option C (23 October 2023) exceeds the deadline for responding to the extended European search report, which is 12 October 2023.

The ISA's role is to conduct an international search, and there is no indication that Hassan’s professional background would disqualify him from representing Greta in this capacity.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** According to Article 27(2) of the PCT, where the applicant, for the purposes of any designated State, is not qualified according to the national law of that State to file a national application because he or she is not the inventor, the international application may be rejected by the designated Office. However, there are no provisions in the PCT that make it mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination must be signed specifically by Greta or Hassan; rather, it can be filed with an authorized representative.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Article 25(4) states: “Where a national law provides, in respect of the form or contents of national applications, for requirements which are from the viewpoint of applicants more favorable than those provided for by this Treaty and the Regulations in respect of international applications, any Contracting State may apply such requirements to an international application.” This indicates that there is no blanket prohibition on representatives other than having a power of attorney.

In option A, the Spanish European patent attorney files a European patent application in Spanish for a natural person resident and a national of Andorra (a state with Spanish as an official language). Therefore, under Article 14(4) EPC, this filing would be eligible for a fee reduction.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The option states that the firm's principal place of business is in Germany where German is one of the official languages. There is no indication here that it is a contracting state with another admissible non-EPO language as required by Article 14(4) EPC for fee reduction eligibility.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: The natural person is resident and a national of the USA, where English is one of the official languages. Thus, filing in French would not qualify under Article 14(4) EPC as it does not involve an admissible non-EPO language.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The natural person resides in the USA, which has English as an official language.

This is consistent with the general process outlined in A-III, 16 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: While filing an English translation and a request for further processing (which includes paying the requisite fee) is required to rectify the deficiency, simply requesting further processing without submitting the missing translation does not remedy the situation. The English translation must be filed along with the request for further processing.\n  \n- **Option D is incorrect**: Re-establishment of rights under Rule 137 EPC applies when there has been a loss due to non-payment of fees or similar situations, but not specifically to rectifying missing translations as described in this scenario.

Hence, this option is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D:** Similarly, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) could potentially be chosen as a PCT authority and an ISA, but it cannot act as an IPEA when the EPO is chosen as ISA. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice based on the provided information is Option A: The applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and the USPTO as IPEA.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_4_2_1.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html"

According to Rule 52(3) EPC, an applicant may add a missing priority claim within sixteen months from the earliest priority date claimed or, where the correction would cause a change in the earliest priority date claimed, within sixteen months from the correct earliest priority date, whichever six-month period expires first. In this case, the applicant should have added the second priority claim by 3 November 2023 (16 months from 7 July 2022).\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. The time limit for adding the missing priority claim does not depend on the date when the second priority document was filed but rather on the earliest priority date claimed, which is 7 July 2022.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The deadline for adding the missing priority claim cannot be October 12, 2023, because it needs to be within 16 months from the earliest priority date (7 July 2022).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. The time limit for adding a missing priority claim does not end on the filing date of the second priority document but on the six-month period after the earliest priority date claimed, which is 7 July 2022 in this case.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law VI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_vi_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_8_2_2.html"

According to Rule 127(3) EPC, if a party does not file its comments within the prescribed time limit, it can request an extension of time. Therefore, the opponent/respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. There is no indication in Rule 127 EPC that filing late comments would require payment of a fee for further processing without first requesting an extension of time.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. The opponent/respondent did not lose their rights due to the delay; they merely need to file a request for extension of time, and not a reestablishment of rights.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is incorrect.

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why C is correct**: According to Rule 51(2) EPC, if a renewal fee has not been paid on the due date and it can still be paid within six months from that date, an additional fee must also be paid. Since today's date (October 12, 2023) falls within this six-month period for both the third and fourth year renewal fees, the applicant can validly pay these fees with the addition of an extra fee by April 30, 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: The application would not be deemed to be withdrawn merely because no renewal fees have been paid. Rule 142 EPC only specifies that proceedings will resume under certain conditions and does not state a specific consequence for non-payment of renewal fees if the applicant's rights are re-established.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The renewal fee for the third year could potentially be validly paid on October 12, 2023, with no additional fee. However, since it’s already within the six-month window starting from October 12, 2023, paying it without an additional fee by this date is not guaranteed as per Rule 51(2). The fourth year's renewal fee would need to be paid before April 30, 2024 (six months after October 12, 2023), and with the addition of an extra fee.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: While paying the third and fourth year renewal fees without any additional fee by October 31, 2023, would be feasible for the third year, it does not account for the correct period according to Rule 51(2) for the fourth-year renewal fee, which can only be paid with an additional fee until April 30, 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html"

Since the application has no more than 35 pages and 15 claims, it is within the standard publication format and does not require additional fees such as a translation or representation.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: There is no need to pay the renewal fee for the third year since the application is entering the EP phase only 25 months after filing, which is before the first renewal payment due date (36 months from the filing date).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: While appointing a representative may be advisable, it is not mandatory according to Rule 159(1) and (2). The applicant is already required to complete and file Form 1200 which does not include appointment of representation as one of its components.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Option A correctly identifies all necessary actions based on the given circumstances.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VI, 4.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vi_4_1_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 159, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r159.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.9.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_9_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_1.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to EPC Rule 36(4), \"The designation fee shall be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report drawn up in respect of the divisional application.\" In this case, since the question pertains to a standard European patent application and not a divisional one, we can infer that Rule 36(4) applies analogously. Thus, if the applicant wishes to withdraw the application and obtain a refund of the designation fee, they must do so within six months from the date on which the European search report is mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not allow for withdrawing the application or requesting a refund of fees. It merely signifies when the search has been completed and reported, but it does not provide any timeframe for withdrawing the application without incurring penalties or losing rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Although the designation fee was paid within the required time frame, this does not mean that it cannot be refunded if the application is withdrawn. According to EPC Rule 36(4), there is a specific period (six months) during which withdrawal and refund are possible.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: The date of the start of substantive examination is irrelevant to the timing for withdrawing the application and requesting a fee refund. Substantive examination only commences after the search report has been published, and it does not affect the period in which an application can be withdrawn without losing its designation fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: EPC Rule 36, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r36.html"

                    "Justification": "- The correct answer is B. According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, a debit order with a deferred payment date may be revoked in whole or in part until one day before the intended execution date by signed written notice sent to the support@epo.org email address or via the online contact form on the EPO website (epo.org). In this scenario, the intended execution date of the renewal fee is 18 October 2024. Therefore, the latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee would be 17 October 2024.\n\n- **Why A is incorrect:** Revoking a part of a debit order on the same day it is intended to be executed (18 October 2024) is not possible as per the guidelines, thus making option A invalid.\n  \n- **Why C is incorrect:** While the execution date is indeed 18 October 2024, the revocation process must occur before that time. Revoking on the intended execution day itself (C) would be too late according to the guidelines.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect:** The guidelines specify conditions under which a debit order can be partially revoked. Therefore, it is not true that \"A debit order cannot be revoked in part,\" especially when specifying an exact time frame as per the guidelines provided. Hence, option D does not align with the given information and context of the question. \n\nThus, B is the correct answer based on the explicit provisions outlined in the EPO guidelines for revoking partial automatic debit orders.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct:** According to the context provided by the EPC rules and case law, Article 90(5) EPC states that if an application is refused under this provision due to a deficiency noted on the application documents or requirements, the deficiency can be corrected at the appeal stage. Therefore, the applicant who received a decision refusing the application based on a missed time limit for filing a designation of inventor could file a notice of appeal against the decision within four months from notification of the decision as per standard procedural rules.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** There is no specific rule or provision in EPC that allows the applicant to file a request for further processing within two months of receiving the decision. The context provided does not indicate any such remedy, and typically, an appeal process under Article 103(2) EPC (or the relevant procedure following it) would be the appropriate avenue.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** While there are provisions in EPC for re-establishment of rights if a time limit was missed due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, such as force majeure or illness (Article 123(3) EPC and Rule 84(1)), there is no indication that this specific situation qualifies. Moreover, seeking re-establishment of rights requires demonstrating valid reasons for the failure to comply with the time limit, which might not be applicable here given the straightforward nature of missing a simple filing requirement.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Option D suggests that all three options (A, B, and C) are correct. However, as explained above, options B and C do not align with the procedural requirements set out by EPC for this particular situation.\n\nThus, only option A is correct based on the given context and applicable provisions of the EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: EPC Rule 112, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r112.html\nSource: EPC Rule 70b, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r70b.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 55, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r55.html"

Third parties are not considered parties to the proceedings and can file their observations independently without being involved in the main proceedings.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: While it is true that third-party observations must be filed in writing, there is no restriction on filing them anonymously according to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Third-party observations are considered by the examining division if they include a statement of the grounds on which they are based, but an official fee does not need to be paid.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html"

The time limit for paying additional search fees is set by the ISA's communication and in this case, it would be until 25 October 2024.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: You must respond to the ISA’s opinion as required, even if you do not agree with the decision. This response can include a protest or an explanation why unity of invention is satisfied.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Paying additional search fees under protest does not automatically require paying protest fees unless specifically directed by the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: If no additional search fees are paid within the time limit, you have the option to file a divisional application for the inventions that were deleted due to non-compliance with unity of invention.

Only the patent proprietor (Firm A) or a third party with a legitimate interest can appeal the decision.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Firm C's role was only as an intervener in the opposition proceedings, making observations on the subject-matter.

The proprietor must pay renewal fees according to the schedule applicable at the time of grant.\n\n- **Explanation for A being incorrect:** Although EP -X was granted, unitary effect registration affects the scheduling of renewal fees. Therefore, the 5th year fee is due on 31 October 2024 (one year after the mention of grant), not for the 5th year as stated in A.\n\n- **Explanation for C being incorrect:** The proprietor must pay the renewal fee based on the year when the unitary effect was registered, which is the 5th year, not the 6th year.\n\n- **Explanation for D being incorrect:** Since the European patent now has a unitary effect and the proprietor is required to pay renewal fees according to the schedule applicable at the time of grant, no exemption from paying the fee on 31 October 2024 exists.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_2.html\nSource: 2023_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 142, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r142.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: EPC RFees 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f2.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why A is correct**: According to Rule 66.3(d) of the PCT Rules, a time limit for replying to notification normally starts two months after the date of notification and must be at least one month but not more than three months. Since the communication under Article 94(3) EPC was dated 12 September 2024, and assuming standard processing, the time limit would start on 12 October 2024 (two months later). The time limit should normally be two months; however, in this case, it is set to four months. Therefore, it ends on 13 January 2025.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B suggests the period expires on 12 January 2025. This would imply a time limit that starts only one month after the notification date, which does not align with the given rule requiring at least two months for normal cases and up to four months in this scenario.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Option C indicates the period ends on 22 January 2025. This timeframe exceeds the maximum allowed time limit set by Rule 66.3(d), which specifies that it should not be more than three months from the notification date, i.e., up to 14 November 2024 at the latest.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: Option D proposes a deadline on 14 January 2025. This is also beyond the maximum allowed time limit and does not correspond with the four-month period starting from 12 October 2024, as mandated by Rule 66.3(d).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-II, 2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ii_2_4.html\nSource: PCT Rule 66, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r66.html\nSource: PCT Rule 80, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r80.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html"

The context mentions that procedural acts may be filed electronically using MyEPO Portfolio, which includes electronic communication and interaction with the EPO’s systems, including the Mailbox.\n\n- **Option A** is incorrect because while MyEPO Portfolio allows for certain filings via online services, it does not provide access to a shared area directly with examiners. The context specifically states that it is \"neither possible to access the European Patent Register nor to file using the EPO's legacy Online Filing software (eOLF) via MyEPO Portfolio.\"\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because while MyEPO Portfolio does provide a shared area with examiners, the patent search functionality via the publication server cannot be accessed directly through MyEPO Portfolio. The context indicates that the European Patent Register and publication server searches are accessible but not directly from MyEPO Portfolio.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect for similar reasons as Option C; it includes functionalities like filing via Online Filing 2.0, which is explicitly stated to be \"neither possible\" through MyEPO Portfolio in the context provided. Additionally, the Mailbox is only accessible and not directly from MyEPO Portfolio but rather integrated into its system. Therefore, the correct combination of options that accurately reflect what can be accessed via MyEPO Portfolio is Option B.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html"

This service is designed to provide an alternative method of submitting documents when the primary systems are not accessible.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The guidelines do not specify using the Contingency Upload Service for submissions after business hours. Instead, they mention that applications may be handed in to the porter outside office hours, which implies a different process than the contingency service.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly but there is a technical issue at your end, the guidelines suggest using other standard filing methods such as OLFE (Online Filing), Online Filing 2.0, or even physical submission to the EPO office. The Contingency Upload Service is not intended for issues on the user's side.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday, standard filing systems are generally unavailable. However, the guidelines do provide alternative methods such as submitting documents through mailboxes outside business hours or making arrangements with the porter during these times. The Contingency Upload Service would not be used in this scenario since it requires internet connectivity and is meant for system outages rather than office closures. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C, as the EPO recommends using the EPO Contingency Upload Service specifically when there is a system outage at the EPO that prevents document submission via standard filing systems.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html"

                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why C is correct**: According to Rule 6(2) EPC, which states that a translation of a document filed in an admissible non-official language (such as Finnish) into one of the official languages of the European Patent Office (EPO), i.e., English, French or German, must be filed within two months after filing the application. Since Korhonen has already provided an English translation and now wishes to file amended claims with a request for examination, he can indeed file these amended claims in Finnish as long as he provides a timely translation into one of the official languages (in this case, English) by the deadline set out under Rule 6(2).\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: While it would be generally allowed to provide a translation into any official language of the EPO, the specific requirement under Rule 6(2) mandates that only one of the official languages (English in this scenario) must be used for translation. Thus, filing into another official language such as French or German might not suffice.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: The statement in option A suggests that Korhonen must file both the amended claims and a translation simultaneously which would result in a violation of Rule 6(2). Under EPC procedures, it's permissible to file claims initially in a non-official language and provide translations within the specified period.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: This option states that Korhonen is not allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish. However, as per Art. 14(2) EPC, an application can be filed in any language with a translation into one of the official languages provided by the deadline, allowing for initial filing in Finnish and subsequent translation as required. Therefore, this option incorrectly restricts Korhonen's ability to file his claims initially in Finnish.\n\nIn conclusion, Korhonen is allowed to file the amended claims in Finnish if he provides a timely English translation in accordance with Rule 6(2) EPC, making option C the correct answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Case Law III, F.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r6.html"

According to Rule 14.3 of the Administrative Instructions, PCT Direct can be used if the priority application has been searched by the EPO and is a European or international application. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The priority application in this case is an EP (European) application filed in French, which meets the requirement for being a European application. Since the subsequent international application is filed in English (another language of publication), and ePCT-Filing can be used, PCT Direct is available.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The priority application here is already an international application filed with the EPO in English, which meets the requirement for being a European or international application. Since Online Filing 2.0 is permitted, and the subsequent international application is also filed in English, PCT Direct is available.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it is generally recommended to file amended claims with the PCT Direct letter, this condition is not strictly required for PCT Direct to be available. Therefore, option D does not invalidate the availability of PCT Direct.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html"

According to Article 70(3) EPC, if a European patent application is filed in a non-official language of the EPO, a translation into one of the official languages of the Contracting States can be used. The UPCA requires that such translations must comply with the formal requirements for conversion as specified in Article 137 EPC, which includes providing a translation into an official language of the State where unitary effect is sought.\n\n- Option A (Translation into Dutch) is incorrect because Mr Linguist cannot use his original filing language as it is not an official language of the EPO. \n\n- Option C (Translation into an official language of any of the 24 states that have signed the UPCA) is also incorrect. The requirement only applies to the 18 Contracting States, not all signatories.\n\n- Option D (Translation into Spanish) is incorrect because there is no obligation for a translation in every official language; it must be one of the official languages of the relevant Contracting State that has adopted Article 70(3). \n\nTherefore, Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B).
