Therefore, if the communication was posted on December 7, 2022, it would be deemed delivered on December 10, 2022.\n\n- **Option B is correct**: The time limit for replying to the communication expires four months after its delivery date (December 10, 2022). Thus, adding four months brings us to April 10, 2023. Since we need to account for the entire month of April, the deadline would be extended until April 17, 2023.\n\n- **Option D is correct**: According to Rule 131(4) EPC, a request for extension can be filed before the end of the time limit without providing a specific deadline. However, it's generally advisable to file such requests as early as possible to avoid any potential loss of rights due to late submissions.\n\n- **Option C is incorrect**: According to Rule 137(2) EPC, an appeal or request for extension can be filed within two months from the date on which the person concerned was informed of the decision. In this case, the time limit for filing a reply would have expired by April 17, 2023. Therefore, any further processing to file such a request after that point (June 19, 2023) is not valid under Rule 137(2) EPC.\n\nThus, statement C is incorrect as the latest date for filing an appeal or extension request following the time limit set by the communication would be two months from December 10, 2022 (the date of delivery), which ends on April 10, 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, B.2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_2_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 1.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_1_6_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_6_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, D.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_d_1_1.html"

The date of notification of the decision to grant typically comes after the actual granting process has started but before it is finalized and sent to the postal service.

The last point in time for an effective withdrawal of a European patent application is one day before the date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin because after this date, the application can no longer be effectively withdrawn as it will have been published.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: This option refers to the latest of the date of payment of the fee for grant and publishing and the date of filing of the translations of the claims in the two other official languages. This is not the last point in time for an effective withdrawal but rather a timeframe related to the publication process.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The date of publication of the mention of the grant in the European Patent Bulletin indicates that the patent has been granted and published, making it impossible to withdraw effectively as it will have been made public.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The date of receipt of the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC does not pertain to the effective withdrawal process but rather to a specific procedural step regarding oppositions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, K.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_k_4_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r15.html\nSource: EPC Rule 160, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r160.html\nSource: EPC Rule 155, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r155.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_1_2.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why B is correct: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if an error occurs during the preparation of the publication of the patent specification after the decision to grant has been dispatched based on the text intended for grant transmitted to the applicant with the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, the error may be corrected at any time. This is because the sole purpose of such correction is to bring the specification into line with the content of the decision to grant (see H-VI, 4). \n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The statement that this error in the published specification of this European patent may never be corrected is not accurate as per the guidelines.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: There is no restriction on correcting errors after the opposition period or if opposition proceedings are pending. Corrections can still be made at any time according to Rule 143(2).\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The error may be corrected even if there are no pending opposition proceedings. The guidelines do not limit corrections to only when opposition proceedings are pending.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, L.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_l_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_10.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-VI, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_vi_3_1.html"

                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct. According to EPC Rule 56 and Guidelines for Examination in the EPO (A-III, 6.6), if you notice that essential parts of your application are missing, such as page 3 of the description and claims 7-12, the EPO will issue a communication inviting you to file these missing parts within a time limit of two months.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. You cannot add or replace missing pages of the description at any time without following proper procedures. The application would need to be re-filed with all correct documents to ensure consistency and avoid discrepancies in the record.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect. While you could theoretically add claims 7-12 if their subject-matter is already present in the description, this does not address the missing page of the description which may contain important information necessary for understanding the invention. Adding claims without addressing the missing document might lead to inconsistencies and potential examination issues.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. While withdrawing EP-A and re-filing it claiming priority from FR-A could be an option if the application needs to be entirely revised, this would involve additional costs and delays. The most straightforward approach is to address the missing parts as per EPO procedures by replying within the given time limit.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html"

Since Ms Smith was incorrectly designated as an inventor, her removal would require her consent to rectify the designation. Therefore, D is correct.\n\n- **B is incorrect:** The fact that no proceedings are pending does not prevent the deletion of a wrongly designated inventor. The EPO rules allow for such changes if they are requested and if the necessary consents are obtained, regardless of whether there are pending proceedings or not.\n\n- **C is incorrect:** Although the patent proprietor can request Ms Smith's removal as an inventor, this requires her consent according to EPC Rule 21(1). The proprietor alone cannot unilaterally remove a wrongly designated inventor without obtaining their consent. Thus, C is incorrect because it suggests that Mr Li's consent is needed, which is not specified in the given rules.\n\n- **A is incorrect:** There is no general provision in the provided information that allows for the automatic deletion of an erroneously designated inventor if requested by the patent proprietor. The removal process requires specific consents as outlined in EPC Rule 21(1).

Additionally, as X was the original representative and did not inform them that they would be replaced, Y needs to file an authorisation signed by the applicant in good time. The deadline for filing the response to the extended European search report is 12 October 2023 (six months from publication), and since this is a new appointment, the authorisation must be filed before or on that date but ideally as soon as possible after being informed of the change.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect**: Option B omits the requirement for an authorisation signed by the applicant. This is critical as per EPO regulations to validly appoint Y and avoid any loss of rights.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: Similar to option B, option C also lacks the requirement for filing a signed authorisation from the applicant, which is necessary to ensure that the change in representation is valid and rights are not lost. Additionally, the deadline stated (23 October 2023) is incorrect as it falls after the publication date of the application plus six months.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: While option A includes filing a response to the extended European search report, which should be done by 12 October 2023 at the latest, it incorrectly states that Y should request a change of representative. The correct action for Y is not to request a change but to take over as the new representative and file the required authorisation from the applicant.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, V.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_v_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VIII, 1.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_viii_1_7.html"

According to EPC Article 122(4), re-establishment of rights shall not be ruled out in respect of the time limit for requesting re-establishment of rights, which means that a patentee can request re-establishment even if they have missed other deadlines.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because the time limit for requesting examination cannot be remedied by re-establishment of rights. This period must strictly be observed as per EPC Article 102(3).\n\n- Option C is incorrect because the time limit for filing an application within a priority period is fixed and cannot be extended through re-establishment of rights. The applicant has a specific timeframe to file the application, which typically aligns with the priority claim.\n\n- Option D is incorrect because it refers to paying the fee for re-establishment of rights itself.

In this case, Hassan can sign on behalf of Greta as long as he has a valid power of attorney.\n- Explanation of why D is correct: Article 48(2) of the PCT states that an international application can only be withdrawn with the signature of the applicant or any person authorized by the applicant.

Since Andorra uses Spanish as an official language, the Spanish applicant is eligible for the fee reduction.\n\n- **Option B**: This case does not meet the requirements for a fee reduction because although the firm's principal place of business and the natural person are residents in Germany (an EPO contracting state), the application was filed in Dutch. While Dutch is an admissible non-EPO language, filing the application \"as filed\" is necessary to qualify for the 30% reduction under Rule 6(3). Since no specific indication that this condition is met is given and the firm does not fall within the categories of applicants eligible for a reduced fee as outlined in A-X,9.2.1., this option does not provide sufficient grounds.\n\n- **Option C**: This case does not qualify for the filing fee reduction because French (an official EPO language) was used to file the application. According to Article 14(2), only applications filed in languages that are neither official EPO languages nor admissible non-EPO languages require a translation, and do not inherently come with a filing fee reduction.\n\n- **Option D**: This case does not qualify for the reduced fee as Swiss nationals are not covered under the specific categories of applicants who can benefit from a 30% reduction according to Article 14(4) EPC. The applicant is resident in the USA and the application was filed in Italian (an admissible non-EPO language), but no additional information that meets the criteria for this reduced fee exists, such as filing \"as filed\" or simultaneous translation.\n\nThus, only Option A provides a clear basis for the 30% filing fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 9.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_9_2_1.html"

Additionally, as per Rule 51(2), this payment can be validly made without any additional fee until one month after the date of grant, which would be January 16, 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect.**  \n  Option B suggests a due date of November 30, 2023, for the fourth-year renewal fee, which is not accurate because it does not take into account that the payment will be made separately in each state and that there is no additional fee until January 16, 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect.**  \n  Option A incorrectly states that the fourth-year renewal fee should be paid centrally to the EPO when it should actually be paid separately in each validating state, as per Rule 51(2).\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect.**  \n  Option D incorrectly extends the deadline for payment without any additional fee until January 16, 2024, instead of January 9, 2024, which is one month after November 16, 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

This is done together with the interlocutory decision.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The statement in option A suggests that these actions (paying the fee for publishing, filing translations, and complying with a formally compliant version) must be taken upon request. However, under E-XII, 9, 111(2), this requirement comes after an appeal or during the final stage of the interlocutory decision becoming binding.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement in option B implies that these actions are not required if there is a pending appeal. This is incorrect because as per E-XII, 9, 111(2), these formalities must be addressed even during the appeal proceedings to ensure procedural economy and consistency.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The statement in option D suggests that compliance with these actions would only be required if no appeal is filed. However, as explained under C (and supported by E-XII, 9, 111(2)), these formalities are necessary regardless of whether an appeal is made or not.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-III, 8.7.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_iii_8_7_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.8.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_8_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XII, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xii_9.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to Rule 159(1) EPC, for a request for early processing to be effective, applicants must comply with certain requirements as if the regular time limits expired on the date they request early processing. For an application without priority that has been filed more than one year after filing and no more than 35 pages, the applicant needs to file Form 1200, pay the filing fee and the search fee. No renewal fee is due at this stage as it would be for a third-year anniversary beyond the first three years of the application.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The renewal fee (for the third year) is not required upon entry into the EP phase with a request for early processing, especially if less than 36 months have passed since filing. This fee is only due once per year starting from the fourth anniversary after filing.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Appointing a representative is optional and not mandatory at the time of requesting early processing under these circumstances. It becomes necessary when specifically appointing a representative via Form 1200, but this action is not implied by the scenario presented.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: Since option A correctly identifies the actions required based on the conditions given (no priority claimed, no more than 35 pages, and filing within 25 months), it cannot be \"none of the above.\"\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 13.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_13_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html"

                    "Answer": "A",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why A is correct: According to EPC Rule 17, footnoteRef29, the designation fee shall be paid within six months of the date on which the European Patent Bulletin mentions the publication of the European search report. If the fee is not paid in due time or if all designations are withdrawn, the application will be deemed withdrawn. Hence, the applicant can withdraw the application and seek a refund up to six months after the mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The date of mention of the publication of the European search report does not mark the latest point for withdrawing the application if the applicant wishes to obtain a refund. It only marks an event that will trigger the start of the six-month period during which withdrawal can occur, but not the end.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The designation fee was validly paid and therefore cannot be refunded under EPC RFees 11 (amended), which states that the search fees are fully refunded only if the application is withdrawn before substantive examination has begun. Since filing and designation fees were paid, the applicant may still seek a refund of the designation fee up to six months after the mention of the publication of the European search report.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: The date of the start of substantive examination comes after the publication of the European search report. According to EPC RFees 11 (amended), refunds can only be obtained before substantive examination begins, making option D irrelevant for obtaining a refund of the designation fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 17, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r17.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.7.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_7_2_1.html\nSource: EPC RFees 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f11.html\nSource: EPC RFees 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f9.html"

In this case, the execution date was set for 18 October 2024. However, if an applicant notices that a renewal fee should not yet be debited from their deposit account, they must revoke the order before the specified execution date of 17 October 2024 (the day before the scheduled execution). Therefore, option B is correct.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: Revoking the order on the same day as the execution date (18 October 2024) would not prevent the fee from being debited, thus making this choice incorrect.\n  \n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: Similarly to option A, revoking the order after the scheduled execution date would be too late and would result in the renewal fee being debited.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While it might seem that a partial revocation isn't possible, the question specifies a scenario where an applicant wants to prevent a specific part (the renewal fee) from being debited. Since the order can specify different payment dates for each fee type, partial revocation is indeed possible in this context.\n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer as it represents the latest point in time by which the order must be revoked to prevent the undesired debit of the third-year renewal fee.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

They can file a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision (Option A), request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision (Option B), or file a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor within two months of notification of the decision (Option C). Therefore, all three options are valid and can be pursued by the applicant.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is correct:** Under Article 108 EPC, an appeal must be filed within four months of the notification of the decision. This ensures that the applicant has a formal avenue to challenge the decision if they believe it was made in error or based on incorrect facts.\n  \n- **Explanation of why B is correct:** Pursuant to Rule 137(2) EPC, an application for further processing can be filed within two months from the date of notification. This gives the applicant another opportunity to rectify any procedural defects and potentially overcome the refusal decision.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is correct:** Under Article 124(2) EPC, a request for re-establishment of rights due to non-compliance with a time limit can be filed within two months from the expiry of that time limit. In this case, the applicant missed the deadline for filing the designation of inventor and can use this option to attempt to revive their application.\n\nThus, since all three options are correct and can be pursued by the applicant, **D** is the most comprehensive answer.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 60, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r60.html\nSource: Case Law IV, A.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_a_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_5_4.html\nSource: EPC Rule 163, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r163.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 8.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_8_1.html"

There are no fees or deadlines for submitting these observations. The EPC requires that such observations be filed in one of the official languages of the EPO.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The statement claims that \"the person that filed third-party observations will be a party to the proceedings before the EPO,\" which contradicts Article 115 EPC, as it clearly states that third parties are not parties to the proceedings. Additionally, while the applicant is obliged to respond to third-party observations in some cases (e.g., during opposition proceedings), this obligation does not apply uniformly.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The statement inaccurately claims that \"third-party observations must be filed in writing and may not be filed anonymously.\" According to Rule 114(1) EPC, any third party's observations must be filed in a written form. However, these can indeed be submitted anonymously.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The statement incorrectly states that an \"official fee is paid\" for filing third-party observations. There are no fees required to present such observations as per the provisions under Article 115 EPC and Rule 114(2) EPC. Furthermore, while a statement of the grounds on which the observation is based must be included (Rule 114(2) EPC), this is not a requirement for considering an anonymous submission.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html"

The deadline would be 25 November 2024, not 25 October 2024.\n- Option B is correct as per the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, which state that a provisional opinion on the patentability of the invention or unitary group of inventions first mentioned in the claims is provided. However, the applicant does not need to reply to the points raised in it; thus, you do not have to file a response.\n- Option C is incorrect because paying additional search fees under protest (Rule 40.2(c) PCT) must be done during the international phase and not after an invitation from the EPO acting as ISA for the European phase. There are no provisions for protest fees in this context.\n- Option D is incorrect because non-payment of additional search fees within the time limit does not result in automatic withdrawal of the application. The application can still proceed to the next stage, but it will be limited to the first invention mentioned in the claims without a search report or provisional opinion on other inventions.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, B.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_b_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-V, 7.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_v_7_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html"

In this case, the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office should prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\n- **Why B is incorrect:** The Digital Access Service (DAS) system can only be used if the priority document is filed with WIPO as receiving Office under the PCT. Since the application in question was filed directly with the EPO, DAS cannot be utilized for this purpose.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect:** While it is possible to file a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application electronically, this option requires that the DAS system has been used first, which is not applicable here as the application was filed with the EPO directly. Additionally, the electronic filing would need to be done via the appropriate office (Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office) and sent to the EPO.\n\n- **Why D is incorrect:** The International Bureau handles PCT applications, whereas in this case, the international patent application was filed directly with the EPO.

Therefore, Firm B is entitled to file an appeal against the opposition division's decision to revoke the patent.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While it states that the opposition division decided to and Firm B is entitled to file an appeal, it fails to specify whether the division revoked the patent or maintained it as granted. Since the question does not provide information on the outcome of the proceedings, this statement is ambiguous and potentially misleading.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** According to Article 108 EPC and Rule 94(2) EPC, Firm A (the owner of the patent), not Firm C, has no right to appeal against a decision that maintains the patent as granted. Therefore, Firm C cannot file an appeal in this scenario.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Even though Firm B withdrew its opposition at the end of the proceedings, the opposition division decided to maintain the patent as granted, meaning there was still a final decision made by the opposition division. Hence, Firm B would not be entitled to file an appeal based on withdrawing their opposition after the fact. The correct course for Firm B would have been to withdraw before the opposition division reached its final decision if they wished to avoid any possible appeal process.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 101, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a101.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VI, 7.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vi_7_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_1.html"

The publication date given here is October 2, 2024, indicating that this is the end of the fifth patent year for EP -X-C0. Since unitary effect was registered on the same day, it means that the proprietor only needs to pay the renewal fee for the fifth year by October 31, 2024.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The statement in option A suggests a renewal fee still has to be paid for the 5th year. However, as explained above, this is the last due date and no further fees are required post-publication.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Option C incorrectly states that the renewal fee would be due on October 31, 2024, in respect of the sixth year. Since the publication was on October 2, 2024, this indicates the end of the fifth patent year, not the beginning of a new one.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Option D states no renewal fee has to be paid on October 31, 2024.

These functionalities are typically available through other interfaces or portals.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: A shared area with examiners and patent search via publication server (which would involve accessing the publication server directly) are not services that can be accessed directly from MyEPO Portfolio. Mailbox is part of MyEPO, but a patent search via the publication server requires direct access to the EPO's database.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While filing via Online Filing 2.0 and accessing the publication server for patent searches are available functionalities, they do not fit within the scope of what can be directly accessed from MyEPO Portfolio as described in the question.

Since Finland is one of the contracting states and Finnish is its official language, Korhonen can file the amended claims in Finnish provided that he also files a translation into any official language of the EPO, such as English, in time.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** The requirement for filing the claims in an official language first (in this case, Finnish) and then providing a simultaneous or timely translation would only apply if the initial filing was not in an admissible non-EPO language. Since Korhonen filed his application in Finnish and provided an English translation, there is no need to file the amended claims in Finnish before translating them.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While this statement allows for the use of any official EPO language for filing a translation, it does not specify that the original claim can be made in the admissible non-EPO language (Finnish).

Since French is not an official language of the EPO, and the priority application being Belgian (potentially) uses a different language than one of the EPO's official languages, PCT Direct would not be applicable.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The EP application filed in France would have been processed in French as it is an EU country where French can be used. However, if the international application is then filed in English using Online Filing 2.0, which is one of the official languages of the EPO, PCT Direct may still be available.\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The priority application being an international application filed with the EPO in English means it is already processed as per one of the EPO’s official languages, and thus, filing a subsequent international application in English (using Online Filing 2.0) should allow for PCT Direct.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While amended claims are typically required when using PCT Direct to address objections raised by the search opinion, this does not make it unavailable; rather, it's a condition that needs to be met.

This condition is not fulfilled. \nMethod features relating to how the pacemaker is installed in and interacts with the human body cannot be converted to device features, amongst other things because an “adapted to” type formulation does not confer the same limitation.

Merely fulfilling the requirements of Rule 159(1) earlier than 31 months from the priority date will not change this, as the EPO can only start processing the application before the 31-month time limit if this is expressly requested by the applicant.

Since Mr Y is already incorrectly named on the application and his name needs to be removed, obtaining his consent is necessary. Hence, option A is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** While filing a request for rectification at the International Bureau with details of the correct inventor (Mrs Z) is essential according to Rule 92bis.1(a)(ii) PCT and Section A-III, 5.5, this alone does not satisfy the requirement under Rule 21(1) EPC which mandates that a request for rectification must be accompanied by consent from both the wrongly designated person (Mr Y) and the patent's applicant or proprietor.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** There is no option C provided in the given choices, so this explanation does not apply. However, if we were to consider a non-existent option C that did not involve obtaining Mr Y’s consent, it would be incorrect because Rule 21(1) EPC explicitly requires such consent.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Similarly, there is no option D provided in the given choices, so this explanation does not apply.

Therefore, option C is correct.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** Option B states that any sub-licence can be recorded in the European Patent Register. This is incorrect because Rule 24(b) EPC specifically requires that the original licensee's licence must first be recorded before a sub-licence can be recorded. Thus, not all sub-licences are automatically eligible for recording.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Option A states that it is not possible to record sub-licences in the European Patent Register. This is inaccurate because, as stated in Rule 24(b) EPC and its implementing Article 73 EPC, sub-licences can indeed be recorded under certain conditions (specifically, when the original licensee's licence is already recorded).

One of these rights includes the possibility to appeal if the decision is unfavorable.\n\n- Therefore, since the assumed infringer has intervened during the proceedings before the opposition division, they are permitted to file an appeal against the final decision that maintains the patent in amended form. This is because the intervention gives them standing as a party to the proceedings and allows them to challenge the decision through the appeals procedure.\n\n- Option B is incorrect because it does not align with the rules allowing assumed infringers who intervene to have the right of appeal, even if the patent is maintained in an amended form.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 105, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a105.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_5_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_5_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.5.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_5_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_6.html"

However, this rule does not affect the admissibility of a revocation request by the proprietor when there are no co-proprietors or if such evidence is not necessary (as is the case here where EP-B is held solely by one proprietor). The existence of an exclusive licensee in Germany has no bearing on the admissibility of the request for revocation, as the proprietor can still act independently to revoke their own patent.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect: The requirement for evidence that it is entitled to act on behalf of the exclusive licensee only applies if there are co-proprietors or multiple proprietors involved. Since EP-B is held by a single proprietor (the patent holder) in this scenario, such evidence is not required and does not affect the admissibility of their request for revocation.\n\n- Explanation of why C is irrelevant: Option C was not provided in the question, but assuming it referred to another condition or criterion, it would be incorrect based on the information given since the exclusive licensee's existence does not impact the proprietor's ability to revoke its own patent.\n  \n- Explanation of why D is irrelevant: Similarly, option D was not specified; however, if it were related to some other factor that would prevent a request for revocation (such as procedural issues or time constraints), it would be incorrect given the facts provided in the question.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Article 105a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a105a.html\nSource: EPC Rule 92, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r92.html\nSource: Case Law IV, D.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_d_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-X, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_x_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, D.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_d_2.html"

The Guidelines for Examination in the EPO also confirm this by stating that \"A licence will be recorded in the European Patent Register as an exclusive licence if the applicant and the licensee so require.\" This requirement for joint consent ensures a mutual agreement on the registration, which is crucial in maintaining the integrity of the patent application process.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Option A states that no exclusive licenses can be recorded in the European Patent Register. However, this statement is false as it contradicts the explicit provisions of Rule 24(a) EPC and the guidelines mentioned above, which permit such recordings upon joint request from both parties.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** Option C suggests that only the applicant can record an exclusive license in the European Patent Register. This is inaccurate because Rule 24(a) EPC clearly requires a joint request from both the applicant and the licensee to make this possible, indicating that the consent of both parties is necessary.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Option D claims that either the applicant or the licensee can record an exclusive license in the European Patent Register.

Since the European patent application was filed on 13.01.2023 and does not claim priority, it would enter into the national phase within a specific timeframe as per Rule 161(1). The applicant then responds to the search opinion and files a request for accelerated examination by fax. However, the EESR (extended European search report) has already been issued on or after 1 June 2014, meaning that the PACE program does not apply retrospectively for this application. Therefore, while examination will start as soon as the applicant pays the fee and responds to the search opinion, it will **not** be accelerated because the application is not eligible for the PACE program.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect: The application would still proceed normally based on standard procedures, but there's no provision within the PACE program for such an early start in this specific scenario. An enquiry can only accelerate prosecution where it has not been performed within the committed period or when a previous enquiry was made (E-VIII, 7).\n\n- Explanation of why C is incorrect: The application does not qualify for accelerated examination under the PACE program since it did not file before June 1, 2014. The request would be treated as standard procedure.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect: While there are mechanisms to ensure prompt responses by the EPO (E-VIII, 7), these do not imply acceleration for all types of requests.

Given that today is 3 May 2023, and the last day the parent application (the one being divided) remains pending is the day before its mention in the European Patent Bulletin, the correct last day to file a divisional application is 23 May 2023.\n\n- **Why B is incorrect**: The date of filing for the divisional application cannot be after the publication date of grant. Since the decision letter indicates that the grant will be published on 24 May 2023, any filings made on or after this date would not be valid.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: While it might seem logical to think that a few days after receiving the decision to grant (on 3 May 2023) could still allow for filing of a divisional application, based on the legal context provided, any application must be filed strictly before the mention date in the European Patent Bulletin.

Significant typographical errors are generally considered substantial amendments that cannot be rectified through the correction procedures outlined by Rules 140 and 139 EPC.\n\n- **Option B (Seek correction under Rule 140 EPC)**: This option is incorrect because, as stated in the guidelines and case law, Rule 140 EPC does not cover the correction of significant typographical errors.

The pacemaker as defined in the device claim does not depend on the circumstances of its operation but rather includes features that were dependent under the terms of the prior method claim (\"while a person is exercising\"). Therefore, altering the claim to address Article 53(c) EPC by changing it to a heart pacemaker would be impermissible.\n\n- Explanation of why A is incorrect.

The document states explicitly: \"Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account (the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the filing fee (which includes the page fee)).\" This makes A the most likely outcome.\n\n- **Explanation of why B is incorrect:** The option B suggests that \"The fees will be accepted as if they had been paid within the one-month period.\" However, according to the document from 2024_EPAC_open_solution.json, this statement applies only when the applicant pays before the invitation for payment is issued. In our scenario, the fees were not paid until after the due date and there's no indication of an invitation having been sent by the receiving office within the time limit, so this does not apply.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** The option C states that \"The applicant will be sent an invitation to pay a late payment fee of 50% of the fees due.\" However, based on the information provided in the document from 2024_EPAC_open_solution.json and OEB_SUP_mcq_solution.json, there's no indication that the receiving office would send such an invitation if the applicant did not respond within one month. Additionally, a late payment fee is only applicable after an invitation has been issued, which was not the case in this scenario.\n\n- **Explanation of why D does not apply:** Option D refers to Rule 12 of PCT, which discusses translations and their deadlines.

The correct window is more precise as stated: the 15th day before the publication date.\n\n- **Why C is incorrect**: Option \"C. The end of the day five weeks before the end of the 18th month from the priority or filing date as appropriate\" refers to a different aspect of PCT Article 21, which states that the international application can be published promptly after 18 months from the priority date (Article 21.2(a)).

Since PCT-1 was filed on 16 June 2019 and steps were taken to enter the EPO regional phase on 26 December 2021, which does not affect the payment period for the first year's renewal fee, the third-year renewal fee would be due on or before 15 June 2022.

The period mentioned in option A (two months after the end of the 31-month period) does not align with the condition set by the guidelines regarding the relevance of the priority claim to the patentability assessment.\n\n- Explanation of why D is incorrect. While a declaration can replace a translation, this is only allowed if it is determined that the European patent application is a complete translation of the priority application. It does not negate the need for a translation where the validity of the priority claim is relevant.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 3.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_3_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_8.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct:** According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO and related PCT rules, if a translation of an international application is not filed at the EPO in due time upon entry into the regional phase, the applicant can file the translation, request further processing, and pay the further processing fee under Rule 135 EPC within two months of notification by the EPO. This remedial action aligns with the provisions outlined in Article 121(1) and Rule 135 EPC which provide for a period during which the applicant can correct such omissions through further processing.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect:** Rule 49.6 PCT pertains to circumstances where an application fails to comply with the requirements of the Convention (such as the time limits or formalities) and it does not specifically address the situation where a translation was initially missed after entry into the regional phase. Reinstatement under this rule would be applicable in a broader context, but here the focus is on remedying the specific omission of filing the translation.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect:** There are no provisions that align with option C related to filing translations or requesting further processing specifically within a time frame set by the EPO for regional phase entry. The relevant period and remedy for such an omission are clearly defined in Rule 135 EPC, not in claims fees or examination procedures.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect:** Option D involves actions like specifying application documents on which the European grant procedure will be based, paying examination fees, waiving rights under Rule 70(2) and Rule 161(2), none of which are pertinent to the specific situation where a translation was not filed in time after entry into the EPO regional phase. The correct action involves addressing the missing translation through further processing as detailed in B.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html"

                    "Answer": "C",
                    "Justification": "- Explanation of why C is correct. The content states that \"Applicants can themselves comply with the requirements of Rule 159(1) EPC (Euro-PCT Guide 15th edition, 2022, 5.3.007 and 5.3.008, Guidelines A-VIII, 1.1).\" This directly supports that applicants based in Japan can comply with the Rule 159(1) EPC themselves.\n\n- Explanation of why B is incorrect. Option B includes \"a professional representative or appropriate legal representative must be appointed,\" which contradicts the given information stating that applicants can comply on their own.\n\n- Explanation of why C is correct and matches the provided content accurately, thus being the most precise answer.\n\n- Explanation of why D is not applicable here as it was not included in the options. However, if it were present, it would be incorrect because there's no mention or implication that a different set of rules (like national law) might apply over EPC Rule 159(1).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, V.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_v_2_2.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "- **Explanation of why B is correct**: According to the current knowledge and guidelines provided by the EPO, EP1 can validly claim priority from FP2 which includes both claims 1 (subject-matter A) and 2 (A+B). Since FP1 is still pending but related only to subject-matter A, it cannot serve as a basis for claiming partial priority for claim 2 that relates to A+B. Therefore, EP1 may be granted with both claims 1 and 2.\n\n- **Explanation of why C is incorrect**: FP1 being pending does not prevent the validity of the priority claim from FP2, which covers subject-matter A and A+B. The fact that FP1 is still pending means it remains relevant for claiming full priority on subject-matter A but not partial or additional claims like A+B.\n\n- **Explanation of why A is incorrect**: Although both claims 1 and 2 are included in the filing of EP1, the validity of the priority claim from FP1 cannot be established as per the guidelines. The pending status means it can only serve as a basis for full priority on subject-matter A but not for partial or additional claims like A+B.\n\n- **Explanation of why D is incorrect**: There is no mention in the guidelines that would prevent both priority claims being valid, making this an incorrect choice.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_4_2.html\nSource: Case Law I, C.2.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_i_c_2_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_1_4.html"
