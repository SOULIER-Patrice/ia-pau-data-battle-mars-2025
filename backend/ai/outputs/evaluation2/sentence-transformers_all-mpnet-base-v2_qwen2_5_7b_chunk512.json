This situation falls under Rule 13(4) EPC which states that the proprietor can remove any inventor's name without the inventor's agreement if the inventor was erroneously named as such.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A**: While it is correct that the patent proprietor could request to delete Ms Smith, this statement does not account for the fact that no proceedings are pending. The EPO rules allow the deletion of an inventor without opposition or any formal proceedings only if the error can be corrected before opposition proceedings commence.\n  \n- **Option C**: This option incorrectly suggests that the consent of Mr Li is necessary. According to Rule 13(4) EPC, the proprietor does not need the consent of other inventors for such corrections.\n\n- **Option D**: This statement is too restrictive and goes beyond what the rules allow. The proprietor can correct the inventorship without needing Ms Smith's agreement under certain conditions as stipulated by Rule 13(4) EPC.\n\nIn summary, since no opposition proceedings have started and it was discovered that Ms Smith was erroneously named, the patent proprietor can remove her from the list of inventors without requiring consent from either Ms Smith or Mr Li.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, B.3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_b_3_4.html\nSource: Case Law III, S.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_s_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, G.2.5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_g_2_5_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.4.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_4_4_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_3.html"

However, it should be noted that since April 1, 2014, fee reductions for such filings are no longer available according to Case Law III F.6.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option A**: The applicant would not be entitled to a reduction in filing fees under Rule 6 EPC because Spanish is not an admissible non-EPO language as defined by Article 14(4) of the EPC, and there is no mention of any specific entitlement declaration for this scenario.\n\n- **Option B**: While it might seem that the German firm’s principal place of business in Germany could qualify them under Rule 6, the key aspect is the applicant's residence or principal place of business within a contracting state having an admissible non-EPO language. Since Dutch is not listed as an admissible non-EPO language and the natural person resident in Germany is a national of another country (Dutch), this scenario does not meet the criteria for fee reductions.\n\n- **Option D**: Similar to Option B, Swiss nationality alone would not grant entitlement under Rule 6 EPC. The requirement is that the applicant must have their residence or principal place of business within the territory of a contracting state where an admissible non-EPO language is used. Italian is considered one such language, but since the natural person in this option resides and has their nationality in Switzerland, they do not meet the criteria for a fee reduction.\n\nTherefore, only Option C fits the criteria for filing in French without being subject to additional fees under Rule 6 EPC (though it should be noted that fee reductions are limited as of April 1, 2014).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC Rule 7a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r7a.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.6.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_6_1.html\nSource: EPC Rule 157, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r157.html\nSource: Case Law III, F.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_f_4.html"

The applicant shall be informed accordingly.\n\nThe decision to grant was communicated on November 16, 2020, according to your scenario. You wish to validate the patent in only two contracting states and need to pay the renewal fee for the fourth year (which falls between the communication date and the next possible publication date).\n\nOption C is correct because:\n- The renewal fee must be paid separately in each state where the patent is validated.\n- It can be validly paid without any additional fee until 9 January 2024 at the latest, as this aligns with EPC Rule 71a(4), allowing payment within two months after being informed of the due date.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A and B: These options suggest a centrally paid renewal fee. According to EPC Rule 71a(6), if the European patent application is refused or withdrawn, the fee for grant and publishing is refunded. This rule does not apply to paying renewal fees separately in each state where the patent is validated.\n\nOption D: While it mentions payment until January 16, 2024, which is beyond two months from November 16, 2023 (the communication date), EPC Rule 71a(4) only provides a grace period for payment and does not extend the due date beyond this period.

This requirement applies regardless of whether there are pending appeal proceedings or if the patent proprietor has been invited to pay the fee for publishing, file translations, and provide a formally compliant version.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it mentions that payment for publishing a new specification and filing translations should always occur, which is not necessarily true unless these acts have become final. Option B is incorrect as it implies that no formalities are required during appeal proceedings, whereas the Guidelines indicate that such formalities must be addressed once the opposition division's decision becomes interlocutory or final.

The USPTO does not necessarily accept all languages for such filings.\n  \n- **Option C**: The Austrian Patent Office can indeed act as an ISA but there is no information suggesting that the IPEA could or should be the EPO. Thus, without additional context confirming this setup, option C cannot be selected based solely on provided rules.\n\n- **Option D**: The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) might not accept Spanish for filing international applications. Given the requirement in Rule 12 that at least one language must be accepted by both the ISA and IPEA, using an office that does not meet this criterion would make option D invalid.\n\nHence, only option A is consistent with the rules provided under PCT Rule 12 and EPC provisions for language of filing.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, A.4.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_a_4_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_2.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: PCT Rule 12, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r12.html"

The time limit for adding the missing priority claim from EP-II would expire on 3 July 2024. However, since the applicant discovered the omission on 12 October 2023, and considering that it is within the twelve-month period from the filing date of PCT-P (i.e., 20 June 2023), they still have some time left to add the missing priority claim. Given today is 12 October 2023, the relevant deadline for adding the priority claim would be 7 November 2023.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.4.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_4_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.2.4, renewal fees continue to fall due during the period of stay. Rule 14(4) states that the time still to run after the resumption of proceedings must not be less than two months. In this case, since proceedings were interrupted on 10 March 2022 and resumed on 12 October 2023, it means that there has been a period of stay which includes more than two years (from 10 March 2022 to 12 October 2023).\n\nThe renewal fee for the third year is due one year after the filing date or the earliest priority date, and the renewal fee for the fourth year is due at the end of the second year. Given that the application was filed on 20 March 2020, the renewal fees for the third and fourth years should have been paid by 19 March 2023 and 18 March 2024, respectively.\n\nSince the proceedings are resumed on 12 October 2023, at least two months (from 12 October to 12 December 2023) must elapse before the renewal fees for the third year can be paid. The renewal fee for the fourth year would then need to be paid by 12 February 2024 after resumption plus another month.\n\nTherefore, option B states that 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023 at the latest,' which is incorrect according to Rule 51(2) EPC. According to this rule, an additional fee of 50% of the basic renewal fee must accompany the payment of a late-paid third year or fourth year renewal fee.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: 'As no renewal fees have been paid, the application is deemed to be withdrawn.' This statement is incorrect because under Rule 142 EPC, the application will not automatically lapse just because the renewal fee was not paid during the stay period. The applicant still has a grace period after resumption of proceedings.\n\n- Option C: 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid with an additional fee by 30 April 2024 at the latest.' This statement is incorrect because the payment must take place within two months from the resumption, which would be until 12 December 2023 for the third year.\n\n- Option D: 'The renewal fees for the third and fourth years can be validly paid without any additional fee by 31 October 2023 at the latest.' This statement is incorrect because under Rule 51(2) EPC, a late payment of these fees requires an additional fee, and this period has already passed.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 2.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_2_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.3.3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_3_3_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 2.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_2_2_4.html"

Specifically, when a request for early processing has been filed, as stated in this case, the applicant should ensure compliance with these rules by completing and filing Form 1200 and paying the relevant fees.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- The application is published 18 months + 1 day after the filing date (no priority claimed).\n- The application has no more than 35 pages and 15 claims, which does not exceed the limit for a small invention under Rule 29(1)(b).\n\nSince an early processing request has been filed:\n- **Option A** is partially correct but insufficient because it omits the renewal fee for the third year.\n- **Option B** includes all necessary actions: completing and filing Form 1200, paying the filing fee, search fee, and renewing the application before the third year to maintain its priority date under Rule 28(1)(b).\n- **Option C** is incorrect because no representative appointment is required by default unless specifically stipulated for the applicant.\n- **Option D** is incorrect as Option B accurately reflects all necessary actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B: Complete and file Form 1200 and pay the filing fee, the search fee, and the renewal fee for the third year.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_8.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_1_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 2.3.5.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_2_3_5_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_5.html"

                    "Justification": "The correct answer is C: The designation fee was validly paid and can no longer be refunded. According to Article 10.1.1 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, if a payment does not relate to a pending European patent application (e.g., it has been withdrawn or deemed withdrawn), the amount paid must be refunded only if the legal basis for the payment ceased to exist no later than the due date. In this case, once the designation fee was validly paid and the application is subsequently withdrawn, the designation fee cannot be refunded.\n\n- **Answer A (Six months after the date of mention of the publication of the European search report)**: This option is incorrect because Article 10.2.5 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO states that the refund will only happen if the application is refused or deemed withdrawn prior to notification of the decision on the grant, and this does not apply here since the application was withdrawn before such a decision.\n\n- **Answer B (Date of mention of the publication of the European search report)**: This option is incorrect because Article 10.2.5 clearly specifies that if an application is refused or deemed withdrawn prior to notification of the grant, only then will fees be refunded, and this condition is not met in the scenario described.\n\n- **Answer D (Date of the start of substantive examination)**: This option is incorrect as per Article 10.2.4, which states that if a national application is deemed withdrawn under Art. 77(3), all fees will be refunded. However, there is no provision in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO allowing for a refund based solely on the start of substantive examination.\nTherefore, option C correctly identifies that the designation fee was validly paid and cannot be refunded once the application has been withdrawn.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: EPC RFees 11, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/f11.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_4.html"

                    "Justification": "The latest point in time for revoking the order to debit the renewal fee in Central Fee Payment (CFP) is 17 October 2024. This conclusion is based on the information provided in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.4, which states that if a payment is made too early, either by filing a valid debit order via Online Filing and Online Legal Deposit (OLF) or any other method such as bank transfer or credit card, the renewal fee will be refunded according to the procedures laid down in the Guidelines.\n\nOption B (17 October 2024) is correct because:\n- The earliest valid date for debiting the fourth-year renewal fee under Rule 51(1) was specified earlier: 31 July 2020.\n- Therefore, if the payment of the renewal fee were to be revoked after it has been executed on 18 October 2024 (the date stipulated in the debit order), it would already be too late as per Rule 51(1).\n- Since the earliest valid date is not until 31 July 2020, and the payment cannot be made early without being refunded according to the guidelines, the latest possible time to revoke the order before it becomes valid for execution is just one day prior (i.e., 17 October 2024).\n\n**Explanation of why other options are incorrect:**\n- **Option A (10 October 2024)** is too early. The applicant already noticed an error on the same day they filed, and the earliest valid date for debiting the renewal fee was not until July 2020.\n- **Option C (18 October 2024)** is incorrect because if the payment were to be revoked after it has been executed on 18 October 2024, it would already be too late and cannot be reversed.\n- **Option D (A debit order cannot be revoked in part)** is not entirely correct according to the guidelines provided. The guidelines suggest that early payments can be refunded but do not prohibit partial revocation of a debit order. However, since the applicant's notice came only on the evening of 10 October and the execution date was set for 18 October, it would be feasible to revoke the payment within one day before the execution (i.e., by 17 October).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 4.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_4_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, U.2.2.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_u_2_2_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 6.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_6_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to Article 121(1) EPC, if an applicant fails to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the European Patent Office (EPO), they may request further processing of the European patent application provided that the requirements laid down in the Implementing Regulations are met. In this case, missing the deadline for filing a response to Rule 60(3) EPC would qualify as failing to observe a time limit within the meaning of Article 121.\n\n- **Option A (File a notice of appeal against the decision within four months of notification of the decision)**: This is correct. Under the EPC, an applicant can file a notice of appeal against any decision taken by the Receiving Section or Examining Division if they are dissatisfied with it. The time limit for filing such an appeal is generally four months from the date of notification.\n\n- **Option B (File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision)**: This is also correct according to Article 121(4) EPC, which states that further processing shall be ruled out in respect of certain time limits but not those mentioned here. Thus, an applicant can still seek reprocessing by filing a request under this provision.\n\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor)**: This is correct based on the guidelines and legal interpretations provided. The applicant can file a request to re-establish their rights if they missed an internal deadline due to their own mistake, as per J 3/80 (OJ EPO 1980, 92).\n\n**Why Option D Is Correct:**\nThe combination of appealing the decision and requesting further processing or re-establishment of rights are all valid options when an applicant misses a time limit. Each option addresses different aspects of the situation where the applicant has failed to observe a specific deadline.\n\n- **Option B (File a request for further processing within two months of notification of the decision)** is correct because Article 121 EPC provides this avenue as a means to remedy missed deadlines.\n- **Option C (File, within two months of notification of the decision, a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the designation of inventor)** is also valid based on J 3/80 and similar case law which allows for the re-establishment of rights if there was a legitimate reason for missing an internal deadline.\n\nTherefore, options A, B, and C are all correct remedies available to the applicant.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_1.html\nSource: Case Law III, T, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_t.html\nSource: EPC Article 121, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/a121.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_10.html\nSource: Case Law III, E.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_e_2_2.html"

According to this rule, third-party observations can be filed after the publication of a European patent application (Article 115 EPC). The legal text specifies that 'observations cannot be filed until after publication of the European patent application but sets no upper time limit for their presentation by persons wishing to make adverse observations concerning the patentability of inventions claimed in patent applications/patents.' This makes option D accurate. Option A is incorrect because third-party observers are not parties and applicants have discretion over responding to such observations (Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI 3). While option B states that third-party observations must be in writing, it is not true that they cannot be filed anonymously as per Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI 3. Lastly, option C is incorrect since there are no fees required to file such observations according to legal texts and guidelines.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: 2024_EPAC_mcq_solution.json, Url: N/A\nSource: EPC Rule 114, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r114.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_2.html"

Typically, the time limit would be two months from the date of receipt of the communication. In this scenario, if you received the communication on 25 September 2024, and assuming a standard two-month period, you would need to pay the additional search fees by 25 October 2024.\n\n- **Option B (Incorrect):** The applicant is required to respond to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. According to Rule 164(2) PCT and C-III, 3.4 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, failing to pay additional fees within the time limit does not necessarily mean you do not need to file a response; it only means that your failure to pay may result in certain consequences as stated.\n\n- **Option C (Incorrect):** If paying search fees under protest is done according to Rule 40.2(c) PCT, this is only applicable in the international phase of the application before the ISA. Since you are currently at a later stage of examination by EPO, paying additional search fees under protest does not apply.\n\n- **Option D (Incorrect):** If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, your application will not be deemed to have been withdrawn; rather, it will proceed with the search restricted to the first invention mentioned in the claims, as per Rule 45bis.6(a) PCT and C-III, 3.4.\n\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law IV, B.4.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_4_2.html\nSource: Case Law IV, B.1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_b_1_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 3.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_3_4.html"

This includes scenarios where the previous application is a European patent application or an international application filed with the EPO as receiving office under the PCT. Option B is correct because it aligns with the provision mentioned above, where the International Bureau can use a valid DAS code to obtain a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n- Option A: Requesting the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LPIO) to prepare and send a certified copy directly would not necessarily leverage the DAS system and might incur additional costs or delays, as it involves a manual process outside the EPO's DAS framework.\n  \n- Option C: Filing an electronic certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO would be redundant if a copy can already be obtained via DAS. The Guidelines explicitly state that free copies will be provided in certain scenarios by using DAS.\n\n- Option D: Submitting a certified copy to the International Bureau is not specified or required according to the Guidelines. The process described does not involve sending a certified copy directly to the International Bureau but rather obtaining one through the EPO's system with assistance from the International Bureau if necessary.\nThus, the most appropriate action for filing a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application is to submit a valid DAS code to the International Bureau (Option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4.1.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4_1_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_5.html\nSource: EPC Rule 56a, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r56a.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.10, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_10.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html"

In this scenario, it is stated that 'At the end of the opposition proceedings, the opposition division decided to revoke the patent.' Therefore, Firm B has the right to challenge this decision through an appeal.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n\nB: The statement is incomplete as it does not specify what decision was made by the opposition division. If the opposition division maintained the patent as granted, then Firm B would not have grounds to file an appeal based on revocation (the requirement for an appeal in this context).\n\nC: This option incorrectly identifies Firm C as having the right to appeal. The text states that Firm C submitted observations under Art. 115 EPC, but did not initiate or participate in the opposition proceedings themselves. Only parties directly involved in the opposition can file an appeal against its decision.\n\nD: While it is true that firm B could withdraw its opposition and the patent could be maintained as granted by the opposition division, this option incorrectly states Firm B's right to appeal against a non-revocation decision, which does not align with the legal context. Filing an appeal is only permissible when a patent has been revoked or otherwise significantly impacted negatively (e.g., reduction in scope), not when it is maintained.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.1.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_1_5.html\nSource: Case Law V, A.3.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_a_3_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, K.3.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_k_3_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XII, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xii_9.html\nSource: Case Law III, C.5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_c_5_2.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the European Patent Office (EPO) Guidelines for Examination (D-VII, 7.2), a unitary patent is effective from the date of registration of its unitary effect in the register. In this case, the proprietor's request for unitary effect was registered on October 10, 2024, which means that unitary protection took effect on that same day.\\n\\nSince unitary effect has been granted, a renewal fee is due starting from the next calendar year after the date of registration of the unitary effect. Therefore, for EP -X-C0 with unitary effect registered on October 10, 2024, the first renewal period would be from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2025.\\n\\nOption C is correct because a renewal fee is due on October 31, 2024 for the 6th year (which corresponds to the calendar year 2025), as it is the first full year of protection under unitary effect.\\n\\nWhy other options are incorrect:\\n- **Option A**: This option suggests that a renewal fee still has to be paid by October 31, 2024 for the 5th year. However, since the patent was granted after EPC 2000's entry into force and unitary effect is applicable, the first full year of protection starts on October 10, 2024 (registration date) or January 1, 2025 for the calendar year.\\n- **Option B**: This suggests a renewal fee due on October 31, 2024 in respect of the 5th year. As explained, the first full year of protection under unitary effect starts from January 1, 2025, so this is incorrect.\\n- **Option D**: This states no renewal fee has to be paid on October 31, 2024. However, a renewal fee must be paid for at least one year after the grant of unitary protection and registration in the register.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, H-III, 2.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/h_iii_2_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VII, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_vii_8.html"

The context suggests that these services should only be used when there is a specific issue with submitting documents to the EPO. A system outage at the EPO (option C) would indeed necessitate the use of alternative methods like the Contingency Upload Service.\n\nAnswer A: This option ('When you submit documents after business hours') is incorrect because it does not align with any guidance in the provided text. The text focuses on technical issues and system outages rather than submission times.\n\nAnswer B: This option ('When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end') is also incorrect. According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, the Contingency Upload Service should only be used when there is an outage or malfunction affecting the EPO's systems. Using it for personal technical issues would contravene the intended purpose of this service.\n\nAnswer D: This option ('When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday') is incorrect because the Guidelines do not mention using alternative services during holidays or non-operational periods. The text specifically addresses situations where the EPO’s systems are available but unable to process documents, such as during a system outage, rather than holiday closures.\n\nTherefore, Answer C is correct based on the provided legal context.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-X, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_x.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, F-VI, 2.4.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/f_vi_2_4_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VI, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_vi_4.html"

In this case, Mr Linguist filed his application in Dutch but uses English as the language of proceedings. Since he is requesting unitary effect on 10 October 2024, he must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the states to which the unitary effect extends.\n\n- **Option A**: This option suggests providing a translation in Dutch, but since Dutch is not one of the EPO's official languages and Mr Linguist is requesting unitary effect in multiple states, this would be incorrect.\n  \n- **Option B**: This statement is correct as per Rule 55.1(b)(i) which requires a translation into an EPO official language when an application has been filed in a non-official language. The list of EPO's official languages includes Dutch and English among others, so Mr Linguist can provide the translation in any of these.\n  \n- **Option C**: This statement is incorrect because it refers to 24 states that have signed the UPCA (Unified Patent Court Agreement), which is broader than just the states for which a unitary effect request may be made. The requirement specifically pertains to the official languages of the EPO, not all states under the UPCA.\n  \n- **Option D**: This option suggests providing a translation in Spanish, but as it is not an official language of the EPO, this would also be incorrect.\n\nTherefore, Mr Linguist must provide a translation of the specification into an official language of any of the 18 states to which the unitary effect extends (Option B).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law II, F.2.1.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_f_2_1_3.html\nSource: PCT Rule 26, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r26.html\nSource: Case Law II, E.1.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_ii_e_1_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law V, C.2.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_v_c_2_2_1.html\nSource: PCT Rule 55, Url: https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts//rules/r55.html"
