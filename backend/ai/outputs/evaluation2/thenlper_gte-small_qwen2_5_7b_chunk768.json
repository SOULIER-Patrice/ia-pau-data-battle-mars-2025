However, this does not apply to option B (time limit for requesting examination), as it can generally be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights under Article 122 and Rule 136. For the missed time limits mentioned in options C (time limit for filing the application within the priority period) and D (time limit for paying the fee for re-establishment of rights), there are no specific provisions for re-establishment; therefore, these cannot be remedied by requesting re-establishment of rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because although it can be remedied through a request for re-establishment of rights, this does not apply to opposition proceedings as an opponent. Option B is also correct according to the guidelines but is not applicable in this specific context since EP-1 refers to a regular European patent application (Euro-direct application) and not an opposition proceeding.

However, there are no specific requirements in the text that explicitly state Hassan needs to submit a power of attorney signed by Greta for acting as the International Searching Authority. Therefore, statement B is not necessarily correct.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- Option A: This statement is not correct according to Rule 24.1 and PCT Article 30(5) and (6). Hassan cannot represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority because he is not a European patent attorney, which is required under these provisions.\n\n- Option C: According to PCT Article 34(1), it is mandatory that the demand for international preliminary examination be signed by the applicant or an agent authorized in writing. While Greta has appointed Hassan, there's no mention of written authorization from Greta specifically for this purpose in the given context. Therefore, option C might not hold true.\n\n- Option D: PCT Article 42(1) states that an international application can be withdrawn by the applicant or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the applicant (see also Rule 63). There is no specific requirement for a power of attorney in this context. However, it's important to note that a power of attorney is common practice and likely needed in many countries for formal actions like withdrawal.\n\nThe correct understanding based on the provided legal text would be that Hassan can represent Greta before the EPO acting as the International Searching Authority only if he has the necessary authorizations under German law. Statement B, while potentially true in some contexts, cannot be definitively concluded from the given information, making it the least certain and thus the correct answer among the options presented.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html"

However, none of the options provided specifically mention any reduction criteria based on the declarations or circumstances stated.\n\n- **Option A:** The applicant is a Spanish European patent attorney and the application is filed in Spanish for a natural person resident in Andorra and of Andorran nationality. There is no indication that this situation qualifies for a fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option B:** This option describes a German firm (which employs more than 20 people with an annual turnover over EUR 15 million) jointly filing a European patent application in Dutch with a natural person who is resident and of Dutch nationality. While the firm meets the criteria for fee reduction, there's no mention that this declaration has been made on Form 1001 as required by Rule 6 EPC.\n\n- **Option C:** The applicant is a natural person resident in the USA and of Belgian nationality filing a European patent application in French. There are no specific provisions under Rule 6 EPC that would allow for a reduction based solely on these circumstances, and there's nothing mentioned about a Form 1001 declaration.\n\n- **Option D:** The applicant is a natural person resident in the USA and of Swiss nationality filing a European patent application in Italian. Similar to Option C, there are no provisions or declarations that would justify a fee reduction under Rule 6 EPC based on this information.\n\n**Answer B** is correct because it mentions a German firm (which qualifies for reduced fees due to its size) that has made the necessary declaration as per Rule 6 EPC by crossing the relevant box on Form 1001. However, since none of the options explicitly state such declarations were made, and only option B includes information about this specific formality, it is considered correct in this context.\n\nBut based strictly on provided conditions for fee reductions (size criteria and declaration on Form 1001), no clear answer can be given from the given options.

In this case, the fourth-year renewal fee for EP -A would need to be paid by 31 December 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Rule 76(5) RPEPO states that if an applicant fails to pay the first installment within two months after it is due, the amount must still be paid without any additional fee before a deadline of nine months from the due date. Therefore, according to this provision, the patent holder can still validly pay the renewal fees without any additional fee until 9 January 2024.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n- Option A suggests paying centrally at the EPO by 16 November 2023, which is not correct as per Rule 76(5) RPEPO. It should be paid separately in each state.\n- Option B states a due date of 30 November 2023 for central payment to the EPO, which contradicts the provisions stated and is incorrect.\n- Option D suggests paying separately but indicates a due date of 16 January 2024, which goes beyond the nine-month period allowed by Rule 76(5) RPEPO. Therefore, it is also incorrect as per the legal context.\n\nIt's important to note that while option C correctly states the payment requirement and deadline for renewal fees in each state where the patent is validated, it does not specify that payments should be made centrally at all.

Therefore, Form 1226CC is irrelevant here.\n\n- **Answer D (Form 1226AC stating that the examination has started)**: This form would be used if the EPO had already commenced an examination of the application, which is not the case since the supplementary European search report and opinion have yet to be drawn up. Rule 162(1) EPC does not issue such a communication until after these steps are completed.\n\nThe correct communication (Form 1226BB under Rule 162(1)) provides the opportunity for further amendments before the examination process begins, making Answer B the accurate choice.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-III, 2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_iii_2_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 3.3.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_3_3_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_8.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the provided legal text, the applicant can choose the EPO as the International Searching Authority (ISA), and another office such as the USPTO (United States Patent andTrademark Office) or any other PCT-designated office as the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). This is evident from the possibilities mentioned in the text, where it states that 'the EPO acts as International Searching Authority and is a designated Office' for applications filed under the provisions of the PCT. Therefore, option A is correct since the applicant can choose the EPO as ISA and USPTO as IPEA.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n\n- **Option B**: Incorrect because it suggests that the USPTO should act as both ISA and IPEA for an application where the EPO could be chosen as ISA. The text clearly indicates only one ISA can be designated per application.\n  \n- **Option C**: This option is about choosing the Austrian Patent Office as ISA, which contradicts the text's possibilities since it explicitly mentions that ISA duties are performed by offices such as the EPO, United Kingdom Patent Office, etc., and not necessarily limited to just Austria. \n\n- **Option D**: Incorrect because while Singapore could be chosen for IPEA roles, this option incorrectly pairs an ISA role (Intellectual Property Office of Singapore) with the EPO, which is not aligned with the text's structure where each office performs distinct roles as either ISA or IPEA but not both simultaneously in one application.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 14, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_14.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html"

                    "Justification": "According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.1(iii), the time limit for adding a missing priority claim is within twelve months from the filing date of the European application. In this case, applicant P filed the international patent application (PCT-P) on June 20, 2023, which corresponds to the European filing date. Adding the second claimed priority (EP-II) would fall under the requirement to correct a mistake in the priority claim after the European filing. According to A-III, 6.5.2, this can be done within twelve months from the filing date of the European application (June 20, 2023). Thus, the time limit for adding EP-II's priority would expire on June 20, 2024. Option B is incorrect because it suggests November 7, 2023 as the deadline. This date does not align with the twelve-month period starting from June 20, 2023. Option C is incorrect as October 20, 2023, precedes the filing date of PCT-P and cannot be the correct deadline for adding a priority claim under these circumstances. Option D is also incorrect. The time limit did not expire on July 3, 2023, because that was the filing date of EP-II, which is earlier than the European application's filing date (June 20, 2023). Therefore, it is not relevant to the calculation. The correct answer is B: The time limit for adding the priority claim expires on November 7, 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_9.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 6.9, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_6_9.html"

                    "Justification": "This answer is correct because none of the options A, B, and C are required or applicable according to the given situation. The opponent/respondent has filed their comments within the four-month period communicated by the Board of Appeal on 1 June 2023. As they have submitted their comments in a timely manner (by October 12, 2023), no further action is necessary regarding requesting an extension, paying fees for further processing or reestablishment of rights.\n\nExplanation why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option A: The opponent/ respondent needs to request an extension of the period for comment.**\n  - This is incorrect because the opponent/respondent has already filed their comments within the four-month period as communicated by the Board of Appeal on June 1, 2023.\n\n- **Option B: The opponent/respondent needs to pay a fee for further processing.**\n  - This option is not applicable in this scenario since no additional processing or extension was requested or required by the opponent/respondent.\n\n- **Option C: The opponent/respondent needs to file a substantiated request for reestablishment of rights and pay the associated fee.**\n  - This is incorrect because there is no indication that any patent rights have been lost or need to be reinstated, as the comments were submitted on time. Additionally, the process outlined by this option (requesting re-establishment) would not apply in a scenario where the opponent has simply filed their comments within the specified period.\n\nIn conclusion, since the comments are timely and no further action is required based on the given information, none of the above options A, B, or C apply. The correct answer is D: None of the above.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html"

                    "Answer": "B",
                    "Justification": "According to Rule 51(1) as amended with effect from 1 April 2018, renewal fees for a European patent application in respect of the coming year should be paid by the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the European patent application's filing date. If these fees are paid up to six months before they fall due under Rule 51(1), it is still valid. The applicant filed on 20 March 2020, so the third-year renewal fee would have been due by 31 March 2023 (filing date + 2 years = 20 March 2022; anniversary of filing date in the following year = 20 March 2023), and the fourth-year renewal fee is due by 31 March 2024. Option B states that the third and fourth-year renewal fees can be validly paid without any additional fee on 12 October 2023, which aligns with the latest date for payment of these fees (by 31 March 2024), making it correct. Option A is incorrect because there is no automatic withdrawal due to non-payment of renewal fees; the application remains alive until specific actions such as Rule 81(1) EPC or a decision by the European Patent Office cause its termination. Option C is incorrect since it suggests an additional fee for payment between 30 April 2024 and 30 July 2024, but Rule 51(1) does not allow pre-payment beyond three months before the due date without a specific provision (which in this case is not applicable). Option D is incorrect as it suggests paying the renewal fees by 31 October 2023, which is earlier than the latest valid payment dates for both third and fourth-year renewal fees. Therefore, B is correct because the application can still be revived with the renewal fees paid up to 31 March 2024.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: EPC Rule 51, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/epc/2020/r51.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-IV, 1.4.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iv_1_4_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 5.2.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_5_2_4.html"

An essential step in this process involves completing and filing Form 1200 along with payment of fees.\n\n- **Answer B is correct:**\n    - The applicant must complete and file Form 1200.\n    - Pay the filing fee, which includes all necessary processing costs for entering the European phase (search fee).\n    - Since this is within the first three years after the priority date, no renewal fee needs to be paid yet.\n\n**Why other answers are incorrect:**\n\n- **Answer A:** Incorrect because it does not specify paying the search fee. Although Form 1200 will include a request for the European search and thus requires the search fee, this is implicitly included in completing and filing Form 1200.\n  \n- **Answer C:** Incorrect as there's no need to appoint a representative unless specifically required by the applicant or if requested by the EPO (see C-II, 3.6).\n\n- **Answer D:** Incorrect because B correctly identifies all necessary actions based on the provided legal text.\n\nThus, Answer B accurately reflects the correct course of action for the CN applicant in this scenario.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 5.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_5_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 7, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_7.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 8, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_8.html"

The fees were paid within a month of filing on February 6, 2023; assuming that the application was published in the European Search Report (ESR) within those first six months, the time to request withdrawal and refund is still within this period.\n\n- **Option A** suggests six months after the publication of the ESR. However, since fees have already been paid, this would be too late.\n- **Option B** refers to the date of mention of the publication of the European search report, which could potentially allow for withdrawal but doesn't specify the fee payment status; thus it's not as definitive as Option C regarding the refund.\n- **Option D** indicates the start of substantive examination. Typically, this happens only after a year or so from filing and is irrelevant to the time frame for seeking a refund of designation fees.\n\nBased on the legal text provided, paying the fees within a month ensures that they were validly paid according to Rule 159(2), allowing the applicant to request a refund if desired before the six-month mark.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VI, 2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vi_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-X, 10.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_x_10_2_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 15, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_15.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-III, 11.2.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_iii_11_2_5.html"

Therefore, option D is correct as it correctly states that third-party observations can be filed after the publication of a European patent application and need to be submitted in one of the official languages of the EPO.\n\nWhy other options are incorrect:\n\nOption A: The Guidelines state that 'Third parties who have presented observations concerning the patentability of the invention in respect of which an application has been filed are not parties to opposition proceedings' (see E-VI, 3). Thus, filing third-party observations does not confer party status to those submitting them.\n\nOption B: While it is advisable and generally expected that third-party observations be submitted in writing, there is no explicit legal requirement that they must be filed in writing or cannot be made anonymously. The text does not provide such a specific restriction on how the submission should be formatted (see E-VI, 2).\n\nOption C: Although an official fee may need to be paid for certain types of submissions, the Guidelines do not indicate that every third-party observation is required to include both grounds and fees. There are different procedures depending on the nature of the observations; thus, this statement is too general and not always applicable (see E-VI, 2).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-I, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_i_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-IX, 2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ix_2_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-I, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_i_6.html"

The applicant will be informed about this and must pay the required search fees within the time limit (usually three months from the date of receipt of the report). In this case, since two additional search fees are requested, they should be paid by 25 October 2024, which is typically 3 months after the communication dated 25 September 2024.\n\nExplanation for why other options are incorrect:\n- **Option B**: It is not correct to state that you do not need to file a response to the provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results. According to Rule 164(1), the applicant will receive a search report accompanied by a search opinion, which includes an opinion on whether the first invention or unitary group of inventions mentioned in the claims is patentable and whether all other claimed inventions are patentable. This means that you should review and possibly respond to this information.\n- **Option C**: The Guidelines do not mention anything about protest fees being required if search fees are paid under protest. While paying under protest might be an option, there is no requirement or guidance in the provided text suggesting additional protest fees must be paid unless explicitly stated by the EPO.\n- **Option D**: If you do not pay any additional search fees within the time limit, it does not automatically mean that the international patent application will be deemed withdrawn. The ISA might proceed with a partial search and issue a report on only one of the inventions mentioned, but it would still require payment of the fees for searching the other inventions to fully comply with their request.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-VIII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_viii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-II, 4.5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_ii_4_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VII, 1.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_vii_1_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-XI, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_xi_2.html"

Since this international patent application claims priority to a Luxembourg patent application and no certified copy was initially provided, the applicant must now provide one. The most appropriate action in this case is to request the Luxembourg Intellectual Property Office (LIPPO) to prepare and send a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application to the EPO.\n\nOption B: Submitting a valid DAS code (Digital Access Service) to the International Bureau allows for obtaining digital copies of documents from certain member states. However, it does not directly allow for obtaining a physical or official certified copy required in this scenario.\n\nOption C: Filing an electronic certified copy with the EPO is not explicitly mentioned as a permissible method for providing certified copies under Article 28(1)(b) of the EPC and related guidelines, and generally such documents are expected to be provided physically or through an appropriate official route.\n\nOption D: Directly filing a certified copy with the International Bureau is not mentioned in the Guidelines as a proper procedure. Typically, if the Receiving Office (EPO) does not have the document, it should request it from the relevant national office or via other channels such as a DAS code provided by the applicant.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct course of action to obtain and file a certified copy of the Luxembourg patent application with the EPO.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-IX, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_ix_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 12, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_12.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, GeneralPart, 5, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/foreword_5.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-II, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_ii_1.html"

The appeals are typically filed by opponents (in this case, Firm B).\nD is incorrect because it suggests that Firm B withdrew its opposition during the proceedings. This would likely result in the proceedings being terminated without a final decision from the opposition division on the merits of the case. If the opposition was withdrawn and the patent maintained, there would be no basis for an appeal by Firm B.\n\nIn conclusion, if the opposition division decides to revoke the European patent under Art. 101(2), firm B has the right to file an appeal against this decision (option A).\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Case Law III, N.2.3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_n_2_3.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_3_2.html\nSource: Case Law III, Q.1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iii_q_1_1.html\nSource: Case Law IV, C.8.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/case-law/2022/clr_iv_c_8_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, D-VIII, 1.2.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/d_viii_1_2_1.html"

The service is aimed at handling system outages and maintenance periods.\n  \n- **Option B (When the EPO filing systems are functioning correctly, but you encounter a technical issue at your end):** In this case, there would be no need to use the contingency upload service as the EPO's systems are functioning fine. The issue lies with the applicant's own equipment or network and should be resolved accordingly.\n\n- **Option D (When the EPO is closed due to an official holiday):** Although it might affect submission of documents, a system outage would still not occur on holidays.

Option A states that the claims must be filed in Finnish with an additional simultaneous translation into English, which is not required by the guidelines. Option B mentions 'any official language,' but it fails to specify that a translation must be provided simultaneously or in time for compliance. Option D incorrectly asserts that Korhonen cannot file the amended claims in Finnish, which is against the regulation allowing applications in non-official EPO languages.

Thus, it cannot be applied to a Belgian application filed in French.\n\n**Option C: Incorrect**\n- While this option correctly mentions the use of Online Filing 2.0 and that both priority and subsequent international applications are in English, which might seem correct at first glance. However, PCT Direct is only available for EP (European Patent) applications or international applications filed with the EPO, not for any international application filed directly with the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).\n\n**Option D: Incorrect**\n- Although this option correctly states that amended claims should be included in a single PDF document as per PCT Direct's requirements, it is not the primary reason why these applications are not available through PCT Direct. The key issue lies with the type of priority application and its language.\n\nIn conclusion, B is correct because it accurately describes the conditions under which PCT Direct can be utilized for an EP application filed in French and a subsequent international application filed in English via Online Filing 2.0.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, G-IV, 5.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_iv_5_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-II, 6.4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_ii_6_4.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-III, 3.3.2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_iii_3_3_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, B-VIII, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/b_viii_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, C-V, 3, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/c_v_3.html"

Since the unitary effect would extend to 18 states, Mr Linguist must provide a translation into an official language of any of these states.\n\n### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:\n- **Option A: Dutch** - Although the application was originally filed in Dutch and might still be comprehensible by Dutch speakers, it does not comply with the requirement for translations into the official languages of the states where unitary effect applies. The specification must therefore be translated into one of these 18 state's official languages.\n  \n- **Option C: Spanish** - While Spain is indeed a member state and thus has an official language (Spanish), there are 24 signatory states to the Unified Patent Court Agreement (UPCA). Since the unitary effect applies only to the 18 states of the EPC, and not all UPCA signatories, providing translations into Spanish would be unnecessary as it does not cover all relevant jurisdictions.\n\n- **Option D: English** - Although English is an official language in some states, such as the United Kingdom, the requirement for a translation specifically applies to any of the 18 EPC member states. Providing a translation solely into English would not satisfy this requirement for all relevant jurisdictions where unitary effect will apply.\n\nSources:\n\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 2, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_2.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, A-VII, 1.1, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/a_vii_1_1.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-V, 6, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_v_6.html\nSource: Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, E-XIII, 4, Url: https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/e_xiii_4.html"
