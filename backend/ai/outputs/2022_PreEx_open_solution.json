However, \n\nnovelty as a new ground may be considered in view of the same document used \n\nfor deciding upon the ground of lack of inventive step (Article 114(1) EPC, Rule \n\n81(1) EPC, G7/95). \n \n2.2 \nIf the opposition division considers that the subject-matter of claim 2 lacks \n\ninventive step over D2 in combination with D3, the opposition division may revoke \n\nEP-1 for lack of inventive step of the subject-matter of claim 2 over D2 in \n\ncombination with D3. \n\nFalse\n: The extent of the opposition defines the competence of the opposition \n\ndivision.

Only \nsubject- matters of claims depending on an independent claim, \n\nwhich falls in opposition proceedings, may be examined as to their patentability \n\neven if they have not been explicitly opposed\n (G9/91).
