    return {'Answer': 'Answer B.', 'Justification': 'Explanation: According to the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, amendments can be made both in the international and European phases of a patent application, provided they are consistent with the original filing date. In this case, since no priority is claimed and the applicant files an international application that enters the European phase 19 months after the filing date, the application would enter the national phase and thus be subject to EPO examination rules. - **Option A** states that amendments can only be made in the international phase, which is incorrect because the Guidelines specifically mention that amendments are allowed during both the international and European phases. - **Option C** suggests no amendments can be made until after receiving the search report. This is incorrect as the Guidelines allow for certain types of amendments to be made before the search report has been issued.- **Option D** claims that amendments can be made at any time before the grant of the patent, which is also inaccurate because amendments must meet specific admissibility and allowability criteria, especially regarding what was originally disclosed in the application as filed (Art. 123(2)) and not extending protection conferred by a granted patent (Art. 123(3)).The correct statement is B, indicating that amendments can be made both during the international phase and when the application enters the European phase, provided they comply with certain conditions outlined in Art. 123(2) and Art. 123(3).'}

    Answer:
 

    Based on the information provided in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO:

    1. **Languages for Filing:**
    - According to Rule 6(3) of the Guidelines, an application filed in a non-official language (such as Japanese) will be accepted by the EPO, and the applicant will have to provide a translation into one of the official languages within the specified timeframe.
    
    2. **Translation Submission Deadline:**
    - The translation must be submitted within two months from the filing date of the application according to Rule 6(1). Since the Japanese application was filed on March 15, 2023, the deadline for submitting a translation would be May 14, 2023.

    3. **Consequences of Failing to File Translation:**
    - If the translation is not provided by the specified deadline and Rule 58 is invoked, the application may be deemed withdrawn according to Art. 14(2) as per Rule 6(1). This can be seen from the relevant text in A-VII, 1.1:
        - "If the translation has not been filed, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency underRule 58 within two months in accordance with the procedure explained inA-III, 16."
    - Further, if the application is deemed withdrawn due to non-compliance, Rule 112(1) dictates that the EPO will notify the applicant of this loss of rights.
        - "The EPO will then notify the applicant of this loss of rights according toRule 112(1)."

    The above points are derived directly from the provided guidelines and rules. Therefore, it is crucial for the Japanese company to ensure compliance with these deadlines to avoid any potential loss of rights associated with their European patent application.

    res = """### Feedback on User's Answer:

#### a) Languages for Filing:
The user's response is partially correct. The Japanese company can use Japanese as the language of filing, but this must be accompanied by translations into one of the EPOâ€™s official languages (German, English, or French). According to Rule 159(1)(a) and (b) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), a translation into German, English, or French must be filed upon entry into the European phase. However, the user did not specify this requirement.

#### b) Translation Submission:
The user's response is correct but incomplete. According to Rule 159(1)(a) EPC and A-VII, 1.2 of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, a translation into German, English, or French must be filed upon entry into the European phase (which would typically occur within 6 months from the filing date).

#### c) Consequences of Non-Compliance:
The user's response is correct but not fully detailed. According to Rule 58(2), if the translation has not been filed by the deadline, the EPO will invite the applicant to rectify this deficiency under Rule 58 within two months in accordance with A-III, 16 (explanations on how to rectify deficiencies). If the deficiency is not rectified within that period, Rule 112(1) provides that the EPO will notify the applicant of the loss of rights.

### Corrected and Detailed Answers:

#### a) Languages for Filing:
**Languages that can be used:**
- The Japanese company can file its European patent application in Japanese.
- However, this must be accompanied by translations into one of the EPO's official languages (German, English, or French).

**Legal Context and Sources:**
- **Rule 159(1)(a) EPC:** "The language of the proceedings shall be the language of the original application in the case of a European patent application filed in a language other than an official language."
- **Rule 159(2)(b) EPC:** "A translation into one of the official languages of the EPO (German, English or French) must be submitted upon entry into the European phase."

#### b) Translation Submission:
**When to submit the translation:**
- The translation into German, English, or French must be filed upon entry into the European phase. This is typically within 6 months from the filing date.

    Hello! It sounds like you're interested in understanding more about claims that define an invention by reference to another entity through use. Let's break this down step-by-step using some examples from the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO.

    ### Definition by Reference to Another Entity

    In a situation where a claim is directed towards a physical entity (like a cylinder head), but its definition depends on features related to another entity that it's used with, you need to be clear about what exactly your invention encompasses. For instance:

    - **Claim Example:** "A cylinder head for an engine."

    In this case, the cylinder head is being defined based on how it fits or functions within the context of an engine.

    ### Interpreting the Claim

    Now, let's look at how this claim might be interpreted by someone examining your patent application. The key points to consider are:

    1. **Independence of Entities:** 
    - Since the cylinder head can often be produced and sold separately from the engine, it is typically treated as a standalone invention.
    - This means that unless explicitly stated otherwise, the claim will not include the features of the engine itself.

    2. **Features Suitability:**
    - The cylinder head must still meet specific requirements to function properly within the described engine (e.g., it needs to fit correctly and perform its intended purpose).
    - However, these engine-specific features do not limit the scope of protection for the cylinder head per se; they merely ensure that it functions as intended when used in a particular engine design.

    3. **Combination Claims:**
    - If you want the features of the other entity (like an engine) to be considered part of the claimed invention, then your claim should explicitly state this.
    - For instance, instead of saying "a cylinder head for an engine," you might write something like:
